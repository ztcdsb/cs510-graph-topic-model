1790###talk.politics.guns###no surrender lenda jackson no surrender delivered by lenda jackson at the rkba rally in denver april it is a fact of modern life that urban residents particularly women feel threatened a certain number of them actually are threatened there are immediate threats the things that women will tell you they re afraid of the noise downstairs at night the lonely walk to the car the stranger at the door the abusive husband finally kicked out of the house as he threatens to hurt her and their children the burglar the mugger the rapist and what are we told is the solution move get a dog keep the door locked call the police as a next to last resort learn martial arts and always there s the implied question what s a pretty little thing like you doing without a husband around to protect you but what if you don t like dogs like living alone don t have years to devote learning judo what if after examining the facts a woman learns that rape victims using armed resistance were less likely to have the rape completed and were less likely to be injured kleck than those using any other form of resistance kleck also true for robbery assault kleck what if to our horror and despair we find that citizens cannot depend on the police for effective protection they usually respond after a crime has been committed in truth the supreme court has held that the police are not responsible for protecting any individual only the whole community as a society are we going to ask women once again to sacrifice themselves are we going to continue to deny women the ability to help themselves here s a thought neil smith in his book the probability broach says no pound thug can threaten the well being or dignity of a pound woman who has two pounds of iron to even things out but if a woman decides to protect herself with the easiest most efficient means possible people especially other women are horrified eughh how could you i d be terrified they ask how could you hurt someone they ll repeat the lie it ll just get taken away from you in truth of defensive gun uses result in the offender taking the gun away from the victim kleck well despite the lies and the social pressure some of us have already made that hard choice we ve decided that we are not going to be victimized by the muggers burglars or rapists we re buying more guns than every before we re learning how to use them and teaching others women and men how to use them most importantly we are preparing ourselves mentally to use our firearms for our own defense we re taking our own security literally into our own hands we re going to stop begging and pleading and marching and what we intend is to really take back the night but there s another threat more insatiable than any mugger more secretive than any burglar more soul destroying than any rapist that menace is government and it threatens us all we know that governments throughout time have suppressed rights and oppressed people it s the way they survive in our names and with our money it interferes with innocent people both at home and abroad it lies to us cheats us steals from us and threatens us with violence no one knows exactly what it ll do next what freedom we will lose because some government goon decides it s for your own safety or we know best any person who acted like government does would be psychoanalyzed within an inch of his life and locked up as a habitual offender but this monster called government persists and grows and we who should be its masters have become its unwilling slaves do you doubt me then why did you file your income tax like any reasonable person i believe that being afraid of something that can hurt you is smart and that paranoia isn t crazy if someone s really after you and make no mistake they re after you and they re after me their names are familiar brady and reynolds groff metzenbahm moynihan and clinton if we re lucky they ll settle for our assault rifles our shotguns our handguns and our ammunition as citizens we have only two choices they are the same two choices given to women to surrender or to fight surrender leads to the gulag to the genocide of pol pot to the disappearances to dachau i do not intend to surrender a battle can be philosophical or political in the main the people keep the government honest by threatening to vote it out of office but if they have to they will keep in mind the words of thomas jefferson the tree of liberty must be well watered with the blood of patriots as a patriot i will point out the error in the government s ways i will do my best to vote the villains out of office i will protest and write and speak and teach our children justice honor and truth and always remember that rebellion can lead to bunker hill and saratoga or it can lead to tiananmen square when the time comes to stand up if i have to give my life to keep them from going too far if there is a tiananmen square in our future i intend to be there and no matter what lies they tell and no matter what laws they pass i intend to meet them with something more substantial in my hand than a brick my opinions are of course my own

to kill people not to shoot target or to have something more macho than stamps to collect fire an anschutz then come back and talk to us you re letting ignorance and possibly fear cloud your thinking either that or this is sour grapes because we beat you in the olympic shooting events funny you d think biathalon would be a natural sport for the norse it is more easy to kill injure someone with a gun than with a knife or a bat as in baseball precisely that makes them the best method of defense for the citizenry not everybody has the time to train with a gladius you know but for some reason those who prey on others seem to have more free time to extend this a bit further you need only a certain level of competence to beat another with a range weapon getting in their face with a weapon and winning is much more difficult and requires more training time the average citizen just does not have i ve spent a few years practicing with a sword i can take the common person armed with one though self defense isn t the reason i own one my kid sister would have an even chance of beating me gun vs gun with only a month of training that makes firearms much better in our eyes it s not very wise to compare two completely different countries like usa and let s say island on issues like crime and violence excellent point perhaps you aren t so naive after all yes the problem is people committing crimes not the tools beeing used but should be taken into concideration taken into consideration in what respect though quite wrong let s make it a blanket statement for weapons in general this has been taken into consideration we call use of them aggrivated assault assault with a deadly weapon assault with intent to kill attempted murder and a whole host of others and tack on extra prison time we have a very strict gun legislation in norway but until recently it was possible for enyone over years to buy a shotgun shotguns are used mainly for hunting in norway but because it was so easy to accuire one it was the most used gun in crimes in norway i suspect it was about the only weapon available you conquered your land among others a full millenia before we were thought of and shortly thereafter weapons weren t quite so common i suspect that a few world wars made a difference too since in times of emergency weapons tend to be turned in or donated to needy causes i m curious though were the weapons used in the crimes bought shortly before the crime or were they aquired by other means any requirements other than just registering the shotgun and unbelievable the use of guns in crime fell there are now a new law against wearing long knives in public and why should it be allowed come on down to honest erik s used swords here s a slightly used short sword the battlefield supremacy weapon of the eleventh century only with trade in easy financing sorry i couldn t resist you guys still slicing each other with long knives or is this really not a problem what i as an scandinavian have problems to understand is that you americans have a more liberal view on guns and violence than on nudity and sex try showing a bare breast on tv insted of violence and murder i m all for that what gets me is that scandanavians and yes i m only a couple generations off the longship used to be some of the most feared warriors on the planet a mere millenia ago yet now seem to spend their time sitting in spas and doing a bit of topless sunbathing maybe you had a bit more time and a more homogeneous culture to become civilized with yes i know a little american history but is it a civil human right to have an assault gun in your home and or an handgun in your car yes we re too damned violent partially i believe because we are not a homogeneous culture and don t identify ourselves as americans first and foremost i m rather proud of my norwegian and danish heritage whereas i suspect you couldn t care less about that welsh blood in your veins thanks to a raid in ireland back in the time scale and the homogeneous culture are important equally important is a basic philosophical difference in personal versus collective good in america the individual is more important than the masses personal liberties are prized above all this is sadly changing of late but i trust you notice how this call for freedom makes laws that restrict individuals for little collective benefit hateful to americans i d hazard a guess that were america less interested in freedom and personal liberty and more interested in collective good we never would have sent our armed forces anywhere one poor effect of this culture we have is that we re looking out for ourselves and it is quite easy to identify with only a small segment of the population my grandmother tells of being discriminated against back in denmark because she spoke low dane whereas others spoke high dane it was shortly after world war ii as i remember that low dane was abolished so there was one common dialect we cannot fathom such a minor thing being a problem because we have even more obvious means of identifying an outsider the bad english is not my fault it s probably the keyboard software or the quality of the subtext on tv take heart yours is better than of what gets posted by native speakers any helpful hints for our educational system people have this annoying tendency to drop out of

2073###comp.graphics###re sgi sales practices was crimson was kubota announcement my comment regarding dec was to indicate that i might be open to other vendors that supported opengl rather than deal further with sgi opengl is a graphics programming library and as such is a great portable interface for the development of interactive d graphics applications it is not however an indicator of performance as that will vary strongly from machine to machine and vendor to vendor sgi is committed to high performance interactive graphics systems and software tools so opengl means that you can port easily from sgi to other platforms there is no guarantee that your performance would be comparable what i am annoyed about is the fact that we were led to believe that we would be able to upgrade to a multiprocessor version of the crimson without the assistance of a fork lift truck if your sales representative truly mislead you then you should have a valid grievance against us which you should carry up to your local sgi sales management team feel free to contact the local branch manager we understand that repeat sales come from satisfied customers so give it a shot i m also annoyed about being sold several personal irises at a previous site on the understanding that architecture would be around for a while rather than being flushed as one of the previous posts stated the personal iris was introduced in and grew to include the d d d and d as clock rates sped up over time as a rule of thumb sgi platforms live for about years this was true of the motorola based series the pi the professional series the early d s the power series parallel systems individual cpu subsystems running at a particular clock rate usually live for about years new graphics architectures at the high end gt vgx realityengine are released every months to years these are the facts of life if we look at these machines they become almost archaic after four years and we have to come out with a new platform like indigo onyx challenge which has higher bus bandwidths faster cpus faster graphics and i o and larger disk capacities if we don t we become uncompetitive from the user perspective you have to buy a machine that meets your current needs and makes economic sense today you can t wait to buy but if you need a guaranteed upgrade path for the machine ask the sales rep for one in writing if it s feasible they should be able to do that some of our upgrade paths have specific programs associated with them such as the performance protection program for older r based power series multiprocessing systems which allowed purchasers of those systems to obtain a guaranteed upgrade price for moving to the new onyx or challenge r based bit multiprocessor systems now i understand that sgi is responsible to its investors and has to keep showing a positive quarterly bottom line odd that i found myself pressured on at least two occasions to get the business on the books just before the end of the quarter but i m just a little tired of getting boned in the process if that s happening it s becausing of misunderstandings or mis communication not because sgi is directly attempting to annoy our customer base maybe it s because my lab buys sgis in onesies and twosies so we aren t entitled to a peek under the covers as the big kids nasa for instance are this lab and i suspect that a lot of other labs and organizations doesn t have a load of money to spend on computers every year so we can t be out buying new systems on a regular basis most sgi customers are onesy twosey types but regardless we rarely give a great deal of notice when we are about to introduce a new system because again like a previous post stated if we pre announced and the schedule slipped we would mess up our potential customers schedules when they were counting on the availability of the new systems on a particular date and would also look awfully bad to both our investors and the financial analysts who watch us most carefully to see if we are meeting our commitments the boxes that we buy now will have to last us pretty much through the entire grant period of five years and in some case beyond that means that i need to buy the best piece of equipment that i can when i have the money not some product that was built to paraphrase one previous poster s words to fill a niche to compete with some other vendor i m going to be looking at this box for the next five years and every time i look at it i m going to think about sgi and how i could have better spent my money actually your money since we re supported almost entirely by federal tax dollars five years is an awfully long time in computer years new processor technologies are arriving every years making a year old computer at least and probably generations behind the times the competitive nature of the market is demanding that rate of development so if your timing is really years between purchases you have to accept the limited viability of whatever architecture you buy into from any vendor there are some realities about the computer biz that we all have to live with but keeping customers happy is the most important so don t

apr rti rti org jbs rti rti org writes in article bb ba a r vmcms csuohio edu r vmcms csuohio edu writes gun buyback programs will hopefully have an impact on accidental shootings especially youths domestic disputes where a gun is available in the heat of emotion and anger and maybe keep a few guns from being stolen and later used in street level crime what gives you the idea that gun buyback programs will have an impact on any of these things evidence please please don t misinterret what i was saying joe i was making the point tha there is no evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types of common incidents if you re a research associate in urban child research then perhaps you can comment for us on the ratio of the accidental gun death rate to the rate of accidental death from other single causes follow that perhaps with some sort of justification for the amount of effort that anti gunners spend trying to convince the country that accidental gun related death among children in the u s is a serious problem firearms are the fifth leading cause of unintentional deaths among children ages and under i don t understand how the ratio to other accidental deaths is important so guns don t kill as many children as car accidents what is the difference in severity between deaths and deaths i am not trying to use accidental gun related deaths among children as a justification for gun control who needs to be convinced that accidental gun deaths of children is a serious problem i assumed that any humane person would be concerned when any year old got hold of their parents gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends any death is serious wanna discuss match control firearms related unintentional deaths among children ages and under are the fault of one or more negligent persons not the gun did i say that a child who unintentionally shoots someone is not negligent no i hate to repeat myself jim but like i told joe i was not attempting in any way to justify gun control you re right any death is serious that was my point to joe who said that anti gunners try to convinve the country that accidental gun deaths related to children are a serious problem i guess i assumed everyone thought that it was a problem no i don t want to discuss match control i don t equate a book of matches to a loaded millimeter either don t confuse the issue and please don t say that tired old nra line guns don t kill people people kill people sure people can kill people without guns but easy access to guns makes it a lot more convenient guns don t kill people people with easy access to guns kill people more than anything gun buyback programs are symbolic offerings to the community in that sense i think they might do a little good please explain why you think symbolic offerings do good my point was gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police departments might i stress might do a little i stress little good by giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way overall i thought that i had made it clear that i did not think that gun buyback programs were useful providing false hope then is the intent jim i m just saying how it is i m not saying if that is a good thing or not from the police who i have talked with who run some of these gun buyback programs i get the impression that they really think they are having an impact on the community when i ask them if they have an evaluatory component to the program they say well no so in answer to your question no false hope is not the intent i think the intent is to show folks that police are attempting to do something to curb interpersonal gun violence whether its effective or not look if you can t measure the impact of these programs using some sort of pre test and post test evaluation what is the point it must be symbolic in nature the police are essentially saying look if you have a gun lying around and you don t want it we ll give you for it because we care about the community if you i and joe could think of a way to measure the effectiveness or ineffectiveness of these programs we could become rich and famous i do know that the vast majority of guns that are used by youths or brought to school by youths on a daily basis about youths are obtained easily and quickly through a personal friend or more often borrowed from a parent without their knowledge i suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these statistics i suspect you ll find if you look carefully that is the number of students estimated to have carried a weapon not necessarily a gun to school at least once in the past year and not the number of students who carry a gun to school daily well joe i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence or the centers for disease control if you look carefully you will see that you greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths the cphv reports that youth bring guns to school daily and that bring guns to school at least once a year the cdc estimates that out f high school students carried a gun to school at least once in the cdc also says that million elementary aged latch key children kids who come home from school to an empty house have access to guns in their home california schools reported a increase in student gun confiscations between and and a increase between and florida reported a percent increase in gun incidents in schools between amd these are the statistics increase in california schools eh gun control is working fine there i didn t anything about gun control what are you talking about thus willing to follow a man who claimed to be the messiah got news for you folks if the big cheese was on this crazy planet of ours presently he would not be carrying a gun or holding children when they were in danger holding kids time for a reality check son these kids were the children of the people inside who believed that the forces of evil were outside waiting to kill them would you send your children out the door if you believed as they did okay maybe i worded it wrong dad i meant that to put children in a situation fortified compound where harm could come to them is not the act of a messiah in my opinion i m not saying that koresh had control over these children directly but i would hope that whatever messiah there is would not let innocent children die if as he claimed he was the messiah and people followed him as such why did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them burn alive thanks for the reality check joe its been real so your religion is different does that make it his wrong even assuming koresh actually made that decision and the verdict is still out on that jim listen to me i said i m not religious whatsoever do you understand religion has nothing to do with this i could care less what religion they were okay to put children in that situation is wrong pure and simple difference is good jim i am the most progressive and

4516###talk.politics.guns###re long gun hearings day in massachusetts april this is a co authored report from two of us who were there gun owners action league our state rifle association started the day with a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at it was looking sparse about people until the speaker began whereupon about more people followed the loudspeakers from wherever they had been lost and filled out the area something proud mike yacino of goal spoke one of his best throwaway lines was to remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been checked and certified clear of all crimes by the state while the people in the statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of election fraud to hold their jobs nancy snow and amos hamburger were busy handing out id buttons and sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings and telling people where to find their own representatives and in too many cases who they were mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and discuss a bill that hadn t made it onto the official list it seems a delegation of students from simon s rock of bard college alma mater of wayne lo who shot up the place with an sks late last year was being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or ammo to anyone who is not a state resident the hearings were originally scheduled in the large gardner auditorium at but that had been pre empted by the governor s hearings on the framingham eight women in prison for killing abusive husbands and seeking release so we had until to buttonhole our representatives after which we would be squashed into an inadequate hearing room one of my representatives staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy he said oh it must be gun hearings day again the gun lobby is always so organized every year i got a little pissed and replied i m not from the gun lobby i m from your district at your second reporter arrived in time to notice a demonstration going on in front of the statehouse where the pro gunners weren t randy price from the tv news was there in his mirror reflective shades talking to one of the anti gun types and several simon s rock anti gun close the loophole protestors earlier randy had covered the goal rally the room we had been assigned seated about remember there were about gun owners there plus another students and teachers from bard one of us had already reserved a seat the other never got closer than the atrium outside and there was a crowd behind him a cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the crowd from coming in soon after the debate started a loudspeaker was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else everyone who was there inside and outside got to sign up on a sheet saying what their position was on which bills most of us signed up to support goal s position on all bills first because of their time constraints public officials got to testify and first up was the bill that nobody had seen the students had some curfew i guess currently massachusetts law allows a non resident to purchase long guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of his own state previously the law was similar but applied only to non residents from states adjoining massachusetts the simon s rock folks called the current law a loophole and wanted it closed two of their reps spoke about wayne lo and his sks assault rifle the second one hodgekiss a co sponsor had done his homework so well that he kept confusing montana wayne lo s home state with missouri and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery corrected him after his second muff carr from gloucester claimed that the new bill would put the law back the way it was but he was lying the new bill allows purchases by non residents of adjoining states only if they have licensing in their own state as strong as that in massachusetts since none of them do that s that some of the things these two said were really offensive in some of these other states anyone can buy a gun as long as he s breathing oooooo we have some very very good gun laws in massachusetts if only the other states would adopt the same type of laws we wouldn t be having this situation but they won t naughty naughty next up was boston city councilman albert dapper o neill he was there to testify pro gun but in some ways he was a liability he s reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself plus he s almost a caricature of a law n order politician he badmouthed the aclu said violent criminals should be executed and that if he were judge he d give arrestees their last rights pun intended on the spot at which many of the gun owners applauded which bothered me he said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the right direction for the criminals he said this four times two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a ccw or fid and confiscate all your guns if someone had filed a restraining order against you note that the filing of a restraining order requires no warrant no hearing no evidence and no conviction just an accusation senator barrett of reading testified in favor of it and patronized the pro gunners there several times by saying i m sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have convicted i haven t seen such a disgustingly disingenuous performance since nixon whined that he wasn t a crook barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the fid card renewable every five years instead of permanent as it is now the stated purpose is to remove fid cards from those who have become ineligible revenue has nothing to do with it yeah right apparently some congressmen think we re stupid enough to swallow the argument that it s preferable to process million renewals every cycle in the vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn card away from a criminal at conviction time as usual hassle the law abiding instead of the crook the two co chairs of the committee were rep caron and sen jujuga jujuga didn t say much he was a co sponsor of both restraining order bills but caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn t let any bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged he was a co sponsor of one of the restraining order bills as well one of the younger reps on the committee forgot his name was vociferously pro gun somewhat embarrassingly so his heart was in the right place but his arguments seemed to be confined to every year it s the same damn thing you come in here with this crap it s nice to have a friend on the committee but he could have been more effective at about it was clear that the hall jam couldn t continue someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because the loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting so the loudspeaker was disconnected so they found a bigger hall upstairs one of us had to leave to catch his charter bus and so missed the public testimony the other got a seat this time caron began by talking about how he got his fid years ago left the state and then returned without notifying them of his address change he complained that the state record system was not up to date and that his pd back in his city of birth still thought he lived there great quote if you purchase a gun today it will not get into the state computer system until this was also an argument he used against the renewable fid card testimony was heard from several battered women one of whom had been attacked by some guy in his s who had an fid card because he got it when he was or thereabouts they used a lot of emotion and said how they were scared of these men a staffer of attorney general harshbarger testified in favor of this anti gun bill saying how restraining orders were granted last year and how these women needed to be protected caron noted that a restraining order was granted for days and then a hearing was held to determine whether the order would be extended to a year he asked whether she would be satisfied if the fid were revoked at the time of this hearing rather than after the initial issuance of the fid she gave some long rambling circumlocution in response then testimony against the bill was heard mike yacino who looks something like einstein got up and made the point that restraining orders were issued on too little evidence that judges like to issue restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they think is right man or woman and that the hearings for restraining orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts atty karen mcnutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony other pro gunners got up to testify one said he had had to file a restraining order against a tenant to clear her out and that she countered by filing one against him he noted that this would have allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law one of the junior reps noted that this is america and we have to be certain that individual rights are respected senator jujuga reiterated this saying that people who abuse smaller people can go to hell as far as i care but we have to be careful about equating conviction with a restraining order point and match senator another pro gunner got up and testified that he didn t know his citizenship expired every years and that a driver s license was a privilege not a right like the right to keep and bear arms a third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice system and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public hangings senator jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death penalty bill passed and joking responded that he too favored public hangings the speaker then responded i ll make you a deal you get me the rope and i ll tie the noose next came public testimony on the simon s rock bill a teacher testified that she had been the teacher of wayne lo and that he wouldn t have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was outside without his evil gun she said that the loophole should be closed to prevent something like this from ever happening again four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill one of spilling tears for the good legislators one of the students actually shot by wayne lo was also there many of them had t shirts on saying as long as one person can buy a gun in anger none of us are safe support gun control the committee was reluctant to grill or correct the kids except for caron who corrected one student who had claimed that anyone could apply for an fid only residents can get fid s he said how much do you want to bet that this kid had no idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut out of staters completely off yacino and mcnutt spoke again this time noting that the bill as written would affect both ammo and all guns possessed by out of staters karen also noted that hunters in ct nh and vt could be put away for a year if they wandered across the ma boundary somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens yacino underscored the fact that lo could have gotten an fid as a resident student and hell even an ccw as he had no criminal or mental record one junior rep was upset that it would take ma residents longer to buy a gun than out of staters and thought it was elitist another caron said that we need the protection of preventing non residents from buying without an fid because only two other states in the union had fid type cards so complying with all the laws of one s home state was not enough one pro gun speaker replied that this resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming everyone s out of step but johnny all the bard college people were filing out as the pro gun testimony for this bill was made and thus only pro gunners were around when the other bills came under consideration the main bills remaining and goal s position were o h and four others notify police chiefs so they can pull licenses when a holder is convicted strongly supported o h require trigger locks on all handguns sold opposed o h require trigger locks on all loaded firearms strongly opposed o h allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws opposed o h fund bullet proof vests for municipal police supported o s state constitutional amendment for the rkba supported o several on police discretion in the issuance of fid cards opposed o several altering non resident license conditions supported o h ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state guess some of these took only seconds to consider as the remaining pro gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them mike yacino noted that besides the danger in screwing with a trigger lock on a loaded gun that bill would make it illegal for a licensee to carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked caron blew right through h when he saw that we opposed it again he brought up the state s archaic records capability and said this would create hundreds of different licensing systems the session ran late since it was the last scheduled hearing it could not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified it ended at about

1228###sci.electronics###re how to the disks copy protected in article apr csus edu kschang sfsuvax sfsu edu kuo sheng kasey chang writes there are several types of copy protection and the point is to make sure the user is using a legitimate copy the simplest and virtually fool proof way is for the program to somehow fixate itself to the machine it was installed on some sort of checksum serial number whatever so a copy put on a different machine not installed from original disks will not work okay so what do you do if some part of the machine presumably the part on which the code number or whatever that the program has fixated itself upon goes bad you replace that part and now your program won t run because it s on a different computer this is of course assuming that the program uses something in rom like the bios serial number maybe and not a disk based code number obviously if the drive goes bad you ll be reinstalling the stuff anyway i work in a computer lab which is part of the university microlab system we have the wonderfully fun task of maintaining well over a hundred machines both pc and macintosh as well as administering a network of over next machines i personally am concerned only with a small lab with ten pc s and ten mac s i m not the manager but help him with admin often imho copy protection schemes of any sort are nothing more than a major headache for the legitimate user anyone who wants a copy of your program and doesn t care about legality will get a copy period pirate board or no pirate board i too have friends who blatantly and quite successfuly hack copy protection schemes practically in their sleep let s consider what goes on in our lab almost daily we have at least one machine down sometimes several due to some goofball screwing up some setting or other on a piece of software admittedly we being students mostly are not the world s most efficient and effective network administrators but we try keeping even the twenty machines that are partly my responsibility even vaguely looking and acting similar to the average user and maintaining behind the scenes consistency is a real headache but not so bad a headache as trying to remember twenty different folder locations of norton utilities when some guy trashes his disk often we have hardware problems at peak business times and have to do some parts swapping to get stuff working temporarily well i ll cut to the chase and quit boring y all the point is often we have to re install software and copy configuration files etc from machine to machine by far the easiest way we have found to do this is to get one machine working exactly the way we want to then copy the complete setup of this machine to the other nine of that machine s type this ensures us that for at least ten minutes we have ten identical machines to work with having them networked simplifies this considerably as our major packages wordperfect windows etc are all network versions and thus only one copy to mess with often however we need to install a package requested by some instructor to one some or all of the machines for a special project this is usually a hand written or shareware etc program similar to what i believe the original poster was asking about the few we have had with copy protection schemes have caused nothing but nightmares for us to maintain in short don t waste your time with a copy protection scheme it s sort of like outlawing guns the criminals will get your program anyway and you will only be hurting the legitimate honest user write a good user s guide and tech manual whatever else for your program please do this regardless of whether you copy protect the thing and only distribute the manual to licensed users jack the price to cut your losses but please take a cue from the major companies who can admittedly afford the costs of illegal copies far better than you and don t burden the legitimate user with a copy protection scheme sorry for the tirade but it s been a long day here mark s underwood ee student university of kentucky lab assistant boyd hall microlab a tiny little division of uk library microlabs e mail msunde mik uky edu the program is definitely backupable if restored to the same machine depends on the programmer don t use a disk drive characteristic if the user did an upgrade to the machine he she should reinstall all programs any way no document look up no disk wear and tear i did not say that the originals would allow only one install the user s conscience should do that i know i ll get flamed for this but with the increasing number of casual users who either unknowingly or don t care about the software copyrights it s the truth i have friends who ask me for copies of my latest games all the time and when i refused they went after somebody else casual pirating is becoming more of a problem some sort of copy protection will discourage the casual copying i ve seen what some of my friends dug up somewhere latest and the greatest games all cracked within days of actual release you know how many bytes you need to change in x wing to disable the quiz two yes two and don t ask me which ones they are determined pirates are unstoppable given enough time but their results do not spread that far since pirate boards are not that well known and easily tracked once found by authorities it is the casual pirates that the copy protection is determined to discourage what i believe the companies should do is implement the above plus a special patch once the user registers that loudly exclaims upon bootup registered to xxxxx address city state zip and disables the above two benefits encourages registration cuts down on pirating and makes it more traceable because if the patch s registration message is encrypted it will be quite hard to change and therefore provides a stable trail of who allowed their copy out of their hands and thus violated their license agreement this way the legitimate users who does not register will experience minimal discomfort who does major upgrades to their computer frequently as only problem they have is they won t be able to restore to another computer the registered users would have proven they are legitmate users and therefore gains full rights and can restore to different machines on the other hand the software company now have a record of where this particular copy is supposed to be if this user s copy was found to be somewhere it was not supposed to be we know who has broken their license agreement of course a hacker can break that eventually but that s not the point is it kasey chang

1410###sci.electronics###re lead acid batteries part in article apr cronkite ocis temple edu camter astro ocis temple edu carter ames writes i thought the first thread was hilarious so here goes another post some more background information on what has happened to my poor batteries one year i left the batteries in the garage the garage is unheated they were left in their places that they needed to be one in the riding lawnmower what a lux and one in each motorcycle the battery in the riding lawnmower was about years old and one of the cycle batteries was new and one was around years old upon spring time i discovered that all of the batteries were dead and needed to be recharged they all worked properly except for the older ones and they had to be replaced about halfway through the summer they had originally been stored in the garage and i think i remember my dad charging them in spring last year i decided to bring them in to the basement which has two parts one is dirt and brick and the other is concrete i brought in all three and discovered in the spring about days ago that not only were the batteries dead but when i put the charger on them the charger said hmmmmmmmm and the amp meter read around in other words it was pinned the internal circut tripped and i went on to the other batteries they were the same realizing that we still had gigantic sailboat batteries also lead acid i decided to put the charger on them these had been sitting for around and a half years on the brick and dirt part and noticed that they only needed a small charge around hours or so on trickle i tested them by using them at the local gas station for giving jump starts and they worked fine for around of em this leads me to believe one of several things i bought really tty batteries last year sorta true the concrete has something to do with the discharge of the batteries there was enough moisture to short out the terminals in the room where the concrete is the dirt room was able to absorb the moisture in the air better than concrete btw i can almost waterski in the dirt room any other ideas could be the aliens anything is possible the lead acid secondary cell releases energy electricity with the following chemical reaction pb pbo h so pbso h lead and lead iv oxide and sulfuric acid produce lead sulfate and water the standard heats of formation at c f of the various compounds are heat of formation compound at c kcal mole pb pbo h so pbso h the heat of reaction at c is therefore kcal per mole pbso produced note that lead sulfate is not very soluble grams per grams water at c and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is occurring or the cathode positive terminal of the battery i am almost sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms but i may be wrong oh well i don t have a corroded battery to corrobate and i don t feel like thinking through it right now what is important to notice here is that the reaction as you knew it would be is exothermic or energy discharging if moisture with dissolved electrolytes acid rain condenses on the battery a conductive path between the terminals may form this will discharge the battery as the chemical reaction proceeds the reaction is reversible if electricity from an alternator or battery charger is put back into the battery lead acid batteries must change in chemical composition to discharge each cell has all the reactants necessary for the reaction the non reacting posts terminals of the lead acid battery are there to remove or add electric energy during a discharge or charge because the reaction is exothermic it has a tendency to happen though quite slowly under normal circumstances so while keeping the battery dry is a good idea it is not a total solution to understand why lead acid batteries do indeed discharge faster when stored on concrete as opposed to wood or earth dirt one should recall lechatelier s principle which can be paraphrased as anything subjected to some stress will act to move to a more comfortable position here are the thermal conductivities of a some selected materials thermal conductivity material temperature c f btu hr ft ft f ft diatomaceous earth natural across strata diatomaceous natural parallel to strata diatomaceous earth powder density lb cu ft concrete cinder stone dry pine across grain parallel to grain oak across grain maple across grain note that the thermal conductivity for dirt diatomaceous earth goes down with temperature also c is about k and the values for earth powder are on the same order of magnitude as natural earth the thermal conductivity of concrete is around a factor of greater than that of dirt and is times greater than wood it is these differences in thermal conductivity that cause the battery on concrete to discharge faster than that on dirt or wood at any instant the discharge reaction is occurring energy is being released either as electricity or heat thermal conductivity of air is about btu hr ft ft f ft during storage except for the trickle that passes through any condensate on the battery this energy is mostly released as heat the higher conductivity surface will remove the heat proportionately faster than the lower conductivity surface thus if you perfectly insulated a dry battery on all but the bottom surface at any given battery temperature above the storage surface temperature the battery on a concrete surface will be discharging about times faster than that on dirt this is where lechatelier s principle comes into play removing energy from the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion if the reaction normally occurs at room temperature keeping the battery at that temperature requires the removal of any heat produced a concrete surface is a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface store a battery in the corner of a poured concrete basement and you have surfaces removing energy which pulls the reaction along also if water evaporates from the battery that elevates the ratio of sulfuric acid to water this will tend to drive the discharge reaction jeff white jhwhit ulkyvx louisville edu how do i get

then why did the smoke and flames start from three different places in particular three different places where there were no apv s well i only saw it start in one place a tank punched a hole in a wall and as it withdrew flames came out and spread quickly in the direction that a mph wind was blowing i saw a diagram in usa today yesterday and fires started at of the holes that the tanks made a terrible negligent accident and if the government did start the fire then why weren t people trying to get out of the compound maybe they couldn t i ve often marvelled at how people could get burned alive in the upstairs of a story house on fire but it happens all the time what if they were in sealed rooms trying to avoid the gas and didn t know about the fire until it surrounded them remember the israelis hiding in sealed rooms during desert storm to avoid gas bearing scuds cripes mark are you really a college student maybe you ought to stop worrying about increased beverage access and start clearing your head ever heard of questioning authority and besides oh i don t know why i m even bothering ok i ll buy that you do seem totally clueless i find it tremendously chilling that so many people seem eager to believe a murderous heavily armed religious cult despite much evidence to the contrary wellllll they weren t murderous they d never harmed or even threatened anybody until they were attacked by a paramilitary force using military weapons and hardware and as far as evidence what are you talking about everything the feds have said they ve retracted practically as soon as they get questioned in detail about it maybe you and your increased beverage access buddies sitting around the bar slurring stuff like they shoulda killed em all days ago don t feel that way but then you re probably one of those people still saying about klinton give the guy a chance we don t even know what he s gonna do burp thought experiment suppose this exact same thing happened under the bush administration what would your answer be then would you still prefer to believe the cultists no i don t really expect a response to that challenge no problem you don t have any questions that scare any of us most of our minds are apparently more developed than yours the answer is yes in a f cking heartbeat thought experiment would you be mindlessly down on your knees with your mouth open blissfully sucking up anything the feds said if bush were the president what no comeback ok go ahead say it read my lips no new taxes p but then again that is how mr clinton was elected by people who believe that his campaign promisses would be respected by him once he got into office um isn t that how all politicians are elected not in such a great degree bush broke one promise maybe two taxes guns and we held him accountable for it of course it took him the better part of years to do it slick s only been in office days and he s broken lots of them anddd i imagine he ll also be held accountable for that i can just see the campaign buttons now abc anybody but clinton so is there any particular reason the gummint decided to slaughter eighty people are they like just plain evil or what did they just wake up one day stretch and yawn and throw a dart at a map of the united states to figure out who to oppress that day i m eager to know hmmm apparently you just got here nobody s claiming that it was anything but a stupid mistake by a bunch of incompetent public employees who normally don t get this kind of scrutiny when the mess up and as far as how they picked the davidians who knows maybe they figured that nobody d care about such a politically incorrect group as a bunch of fundies out on the texas prairie maybe they figured they d just go in there and run roughshod over the bds during their religious services which was the reason the feds gave for the timing of the raid rather than running into resistance maybe they knew that the bds weren t anywhere near as violent as the feds spin doctors are trying to tell the public maybe they were afraid to try this kind of thing on the crips and bloods maybe it was because the atf s budget is up for approval and they seem to favor doing something dramatic whenever that is the case of course their reasoning doesn t matter only what they did and this time people are just paying more attention to it and does bill clinton have cooler theme music than darth vader not if you mean that stupid don t stop thinking about tomorrow how is he on diabolical laughter all i ve ever heard is hillary s diabolical giggle waffle man seems to have lost his sense of humor does he look good in a cape don t know never seen him in one he probably looks fat and puffy faced just like in a suit i saw him in the rose garden the other day and i couldn t get over how much he is starting to look like teddy kennedy these things must be investigated you first don t worry these things will be investigated now go back to your beer you dimwit i ve heard a lot of people compare bill clinton to jimmy carter and i d like to go on record as saying that i don t think that it s fair jimmy carter was a veteran and he had personal character and even though i can t agree with carter s policies i always believed that he was telling the truth as best he understood it i can t say that for the fat cat ken whitehead kdw odin icd ab

152###comp.graphics###re need help z buffering lines areas together david gorgen writes i m asking for help on a sticky problem involving unreasonably low apparent precision in z buffering that i ve encountered in different pex implementations i can t find any discussion of this problem in any resources i can lay hands on e g the comp windows x pex faq gaskins s pexlib programming manual vendors documentation the problem to be solved is to eliminate or minimize stitching artifacts resulting from the use of z buffering with polylines that are coplanar with filled areas the interpolated z values along a line will differ slightly due to roundoff error from the interpolated z values across an area even when the endpoints of the line are coincident with vertices of the area because of this it s a tossup whether the z buffer will allow the line pixels or the area pixels to be displayed visually the result tends to be a dashed line effect even though the line is supposed to be solid using the pexlib api my approach to a solution is to use two slightly different pex view mapping transforms in two view table entries one for the areas and one for the lines the pex structures or immediate mode output must be organized so that one view table index is always in effect for areas and the other is always in effect for lines the result is a slight shift in npc z coordinates for the lines so as to attempt to bias the tossup situations in favor of the lines this shift is effected by moving the front and back clipping planes used in the pexlib view table entry for lines just a hair backwards i e smaller vrc z coordinates compared to their positions in the view table entry used for areas this means that when a point is transformed to npc its z value will be slightly bigger if it comes from a line than if it comes from an area thus accomplishing the desired bias i would expect the z roundoff errors which cause the problem to amount to a few units at most out of the entire dynamic range of the z buffer typically from to if not i e or bit z buffers therefore it seems that a tiny fraction of the range of z in vrc between the front and back clip planes ought to suffice to reliably fix the stitching but in fact experience shows that the shift has to be as much as to of the range empirically it s worst when the npc z component of the slope of the surface is high i e when it appears more or less edge on to the viewer it s as if only or bits of the z buffer have any dependable meaning this amount is so great that one problem is replaced by another sometimes the polylines show through areas which they are supposed to lie behind i ve observed the problem on both hewlett packard and digital workstation pex servers to approximately the same degree the test program demonstrates the problem on an mit pexlib x implementation this version is known to compile and run on an hp ux system with pex open questions why does this happen am i configuring the pex view table wrongly is there a systematic difference in z interpolation for lines as opposed to areas e g pixel centers versus corners which could be corrected for are pex implementors wantonly discarding z precision in their interpolators something else what to do about it can i fix my use of the view table to allow better precision in z buffered hlhsr is there another approach i can take to remove the stitching artifacts am i just out of luck we here at ibm have the same problem with our workstations i was also shocked when i first realized that you have to offset lines from fills by about bits assuming bit z buffer this seems huge but is only of the dynamic range in those terms it doesn t seem so bad what is happening is that the interpolation in z is not totally linear due mainly to roundoff i believe so the polygon is not planar in z but is more like a ruffles potato chip ditto with lines when you start end at different x y values the ridges are out of phase resulting in the stitch effect you have the same problem if you try to draw polygon right on top of another but with different vertices you will likely see a smeared effect where they overlap example try polygon polygon your implementation is correct in fact we do a similar trick when rendering primitives that have lines and polygons such as nurbs surfaces with isoparametric lines without the trick the lines appear stitched as you say when the application draws lines polygons independently the system does not have the smarts to automatically do the z shifting so the application must do it this is what you have discovered and are doing bravo note to ibm ers the information given here has been previously disclosed through proper channels so i m not giving away any new unpublished info mark einkauf einkauf austin ibm com ibm advanced workstations and systems graphics systems austin tx views and opinions expressed herein are not necessarily those of ibm corp

organization netcom online communication services guest references swood vela lines along the lines of the armed citizen here s a story that some of you may find amusing it s a story about arizona house hunting from leslie fish musician and author one of the reasons i m planning to move to arizona is that despite its lousy economy way race problems simmering religious problems and hopelessly bad government arizona has one of the lowest violent crime rates in the country is it just coincidence that arizona is also one of the few remaining no gun control states in the country well consider this funny story last time i was in phoenix staying with liz burnham i did some checking on the local real estate market that s when i discovered that with my income as provable by my tax returns i can qualify for every low income housing loan in the book with the exception of va and i came across an astonishing ad in the local market paper it offered a three bedroom house in the phoenix area for are you ready for this all of no money down per month total payments christ on a harley davidson i called up the real estate office making this offer made it clear that i was only checking the local market and asked about that house were the walls roof and foundation structurally sound yes were the plumbing and electrical systems functional and up to code yes did the air conditioning system an absolute necessity in phoenix work yes again okay so what was wrong with the house well it needed lots of plastering painting yard work and some patching of the roof and yes low interest repair loans were available okay sez i if that s all that s wrong with it just why are you selling a bedroom house for all of well squirms the agent it s in kind of a bad neighborhood how bad sez i remembering some of the neighborhoods i ve seen in chicago and oakland worst in the city the agent sighs and then he told me this amazing story every few years it seems the big vice gangs in los angeles notice that there s no gang presence in phoenix which is just a quick hour drive from la and get the idea of setting up a subsidiary there well a couple years ago the colonizing force came to this neighborhood it being poor and spanish they figured they could move right in and take over bought this house and started operations unfortunately for them the neighbors not only didn t like this they didn t care for whores trotting up and down their streets all night pimps soliciting their kids dope deals on the corners in broad daylight and so on they weren t afraid to do something about it the neighbors called the cops for some reason the phoenix police are remarkably honest capable polite and prompt and the cops promptly came and swept up all the whores pimps and pushers off the street and away to jail the remaining gang members decided to retaliate in the fashion they usually use in la they got the complainant s name and address off the court records and did a drive by shooting at his house well this wasn t los angeles the moment the neighbors heard the first gunshots fired they all ran out their front doors with their own guns rifles shotguns pistols everything and shot back the car didn t make it to the end of the block it coasted to a stop riddled with more holes than the famous bonnie and clyde getaway car which i ve seen it s on display in a casino in a casino in las vegas the gas tank and fuel lines had been ruptured so the car caught fire the neighbors waited a good minutes making sure nobody got out of that car before they called the fire department to come put out the fire and tow the wreck away by that time the asphalt under the car had melted and caught fire too which subsequently left a large and nasty pot hole in the street the city is slow about repairing small streets so the hole stayed there providing a traffic hazard for several months all this was two years ago the agent concluded and there s been no trouble since but the house and the neighborhood still have a bad reputation and that s why the house was so cheap hearing this story i nearly laughed my ass off i told the agent that if i had the money at the moment i d by god buy the house this was nothing compared to bad neighborhoods i d seen here in california where drive by shootings go unchecked by the well armed cops let alone by the unarmed neighbors if that s the absolute

requirement to that of traditional flight simulators for pilot training if the frame rate is too low the user notices the stepping of the frames as they move their head rapidly around the scene so the motion of the graphics is not smooth and contiguous thus the graphics system must be powerful enough to sustain high frame rates while rendering complex data representations additionally the frame rate must be constant if the system renders frames per second at one point then frames per second the next perhaps due to the scene in the new viewing direction being simpler than what was visible before the user can get heavily distracted by the medium the graphics computer rather than focusing on the data to maintain a constant frame rate the system must be able to run in real time unix in general does not support real time operation but silicon graphics has modified the unix kernel for its multi processor systems to be able to support real time operation bypassing the usual unix process priority management schemes uniprocessor systems running unix cannot fundamentally support real time operation not sun sparc not hp series systems not ibm rs not even sgi s uniprocessor systems like indigo or crimson only our multiprocessor onyx and challenge systems support real time operation due to their symmetric multi processing smp shared memory architecture from a graphics perspective rendering complex virtual environments requires advanced rendering techniques like texture mapping and real time multi sample anti aliasing of all of the general purpose graphics systems on the market today only crimson realityengine and onyx realityengine systems fully support these capabilities the anti aliasing is particularly important as the crawling jagged edges of aliased

4515###talk.politics.guns###re my gun is like my american express card in article cmm thomasp surt ifi uio no thomas parsli thomasp ifi uio no writes if i would like to have a handgun i would have to get an gun licence from the police and to be a member of a gun club the police would check my criminal records for any serious crimes and or records of serious mental diseases now if a got my licence i would have to be an active member of the gun club for months before i could collect my gun so like what do you do during those six months to be active my town has a similar requirement and it s rather stupid before you can buy a handgun you have to be an active member of a gun club well how active can you be without a gun chief most gun owners feel a check of criminal records for crimes and mental disorders would be a very good thing if it couldn t be abused by the government but every time this is proposed there is always some trapdoor by which the government can deny your purchase even if you are perfectly qualified to own a gun and we oppose this it s a little like getting a drivers licence isn t it you have to prove that you can drive before you are allowed to since the fatal accident rate for licensed automobile drivers in the us is around times the fatal accident rate of largely unlicensed gun owners i d think twice before using this analogy besides the problem is criminal use of guns not accidents there are about criminal uses of guns in the us every year but only accidents i don t think it s necessary to spend a lot of energy making sure a criminal can shoot a gun before he gets one just like the check most gun owners feel positively about requiring safety courses if they couldn t be abused by the government but they already have one state doesn t hold the courses another doesn t fund them a third holds them only once a year with limited attendence to those with political connections is this fair most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes and mostly short time befor the crime and how many of them acquire these guns from legal retail outlets how many are borrowed stolen smuggled bought on the black market use of knives it is allowed to cary knifes in public but not in your belt or open you americans think it s ok to have a gun but not to carry it open in public rigth some states allow only open carry some allow only concealed carry some allow both some allow both but require licenses for concealed carry all you can say is if one of these modes has a clear advantage over another in terms of reducing crime or any other public good then state legislators someplace are doing exactly the wrong thing which means that they really don t have any objective reasons for these laws other than their preferences a bad way to govern scandinavians are aggressive we northeners are not as hot livered as southeners but when we decide to take action we do hot livered i love that expression here we say hot headed individual vs masses yes the individual is more important than the masses but only to some extent your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses what happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of all the others typically the only criminals who can affect the rights of all the other people are criminals in government offices the rest of our criminals affect the rights of only one or a few people at a time and they do this during the commission of a crime possession of a gun by someone hurts no one else it is when they do something violent with that gun that the crime occurs of course it is a crime for a felon or ex felon to possess a gun but we don t feel it is right to treat common citizens who have lived good lives as if they were just pre felons waiting to commit crimes we shouldn t mix weapons and items that can serve as one i don t understand this sentence if i lived in amerika i would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in home but should it have to be like that life isn t fair i shouldn t need a fire extinguisher either or flood and theft insurance or to lock the doors of my house and car but pining for a better world won t do anything to address what i have to do to live in this one do you think it s wise to sell guns like candy some states do none of ours i m sure if you believe it s smart neccacery to have drivers licence why do you think it should be free to buy guns frankly i m not sure i know what good a driver s license does anyone either the people who drive safely never use it and the people who drive drunk drive without it however a car is a good tool but not one that protects my right to life i rank the right to life somewhere north of the right to travel freely i m not a pacifist or anti gun i would defend my home loved ones and country but i don t view guns as neccities or toys i have done army service and have used a variaty of weapons but wouldn t want to have one for self defence or because they feel good the question is not whether or not you want to own guns personally it s whether or not you think that all people should be forced to do as you do i don t have any problem with someone who says they

4665###talk.politics.guns###re some more about gun control in article apr mtu edu cescript mtu edu charles scripter writes this mention of a well regulated militia is what confuses me according to the federalist paper s a well regulated militia has a well defined structure and follows nationally uniform regulations perhaps you should actually read the federalist papers perhaps you should reread federal which deals exclusively with the well regulated malitia here is what is says about its character to oblige the great body of the yeomanry and of the other classes of the citizens to be under arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and evolutions as often as might be necessary to acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the character of a well regulated militia it also talks about the well regulated militia having a nationally uniform in structure and disipline i will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states little more can reasonably be aimed at with respect to the people at large than to have them properly armed and equipped and in order to see that this be not neglected it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year but do you knew how much organization is required to training a large group of poeple twice a year just to try to get the same people every year provide a basic training to new people so they can be integrated into the force and find a suitable location it requires a continually standing committee of organizers since a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and disipline and meet once or twice a year to train how can you claim a well regulated militia is not well organized but i will concide a well organized militia is not necessarily a well regulated militia several people have stated that the well organized militia is what is defined under usc which states the militia of the united states consists of all able bodied males at least years of age and except as provided in section of title under years of age who are or who have made a declaration of intention to become citizens of the united states and of female citizents of the united states who are commissioned officers of the national guard this deos define the militia but were is the adjective well regulated usc does not define a well regualed militia in any way shape or form it only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia the federalist papers clearly define the well regualed militia as a proper subset of the militia in the same paragraph quoted above it talk above disciplining all the militia of the united states so they fit the character of a well regulated militia this is what the paragraph states about the associated costs it would form an annual deduction from the productive labor of the country to an amount which calculating upon the present numbers of the people would not fall far short of the whole expense of the civil establishments of all the states to attempt a thing which would abridge the mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent would be unwise and the experiment if made could not succeed because it would not long be endured another quote provide by charles scripter is james madison federalist paper regarding the general welfare clause nothing is more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars so the phrase the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed must either qualify or explain the phrase a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the definition of explain as stated in the american hertitage dictionary of the enlish language the new college edition is to make plain or comprehensible remove obscruity from elucidate it was the economists who undertook to explain this puzzle to define explicate expound he explained his plan to offer reasons for or a cause of an answer for justify explain an error the second phrase clearly does not explain the first therefore the second phrase must qualify the first the definition given for qualify is to describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities of characterize to make competent or suitable for office position or task to give legal power to make legally capable to modify limit or restrict as giving exceptions to make less harsh or severe moderate grammar to modify the meaning of a word or phrase since the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed does not describe modify or make less harsh anything and it has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task by process of elimination it must fall into definition and since deals with legal power the same thing the constitution does it must be the correct definition in this case therefore the right of the people to keep and bear arms gives legal power to the well regualated militia and this legal power shall not be infringed i thank you very much mr scripter you have provided me with more evidence that the second amendment only concerns itseft with the people s right to form well regulate militia and says very little about the right of an untrained person to keep and bear a caliber machine gun and since i totally untrained in the use of any firearm something i personly have meant to correct by going to a nra gun safety course and joining a gun club cannot legally buy such a machine gun i conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with me so now we know which category mr rutledge is in he means to destroy our liberties and rights i mean to destory our liberties and rights is that why a participate in the discussion of exactly what our libertues and rights are i force my version of our liberties and rights by begining statements of what our liberties and rights with all that the second amendment clearly states to me using expressions such as states to me clearly mean i intend to force my views on others i don t think so so in effort not to force my views and not to destory our liberties and rights i state that

4561###talk.politics.guns###re batf fbi revenge does anyone have any idea about the size of waco i m just curious because if it were a small town that may have something to do with it possibly not it sure didn t take it very long to burn down though i was watching abc and it only took like a little over minutes to burn down waco is a city of about people the population temporarily raised to about people when all the feds and state police officers arrived i tell you what i stayed in a hotel room about miles from the bd compound around weeks ago i have never felt more paranoid in my whole life there were at least state police in the hotel the claim we had the water turned off so the fire engines had to bring their own doesn t hold up if they had cut off the water they surely could have turned it back on just as quickly they just didn t want to there were some scores to settle message to anybody else is very clear don t fuck with us we will do you in not that i am one to believe that everything that the government tells us is true but if that was the message they wanted to send why did they wait days i think the message would be better sent by charging in there right away not waiting for days and pounding them with sound etc a bunch of dead bd members are not going to be so able to tell their side of the story so now all we have is the story according to the batf and fbi also mr care about the rights of people clinton or his administration approved this action fbi said washington had approved it they fbi said the gas masks used by the bds have a finite life and were close to running out why couldn t they have just waited well there are people supposedly alive they can tell their story as far as bill clinton is concerned don t you think he has more pressing matters to attend to besides some small group of people in texas how about bosnia now there s a problem why couldn t they have waited they waited too long as it is something should have been done earlier they gov is trying to say it was a mass suicide in the past they had expressed this was a real possibility but now they decided it wasn t a possibility so they could go on with the raid apparantly what they feel korash was or was not capable of or going to do was driven by what was most convenient at the time now this means that the public and media will forget about all this having become weary of it this has already happened for many people there will be no investigation independent or otherwise or a whitewash very much a possibility there will be no unsealing of the warrant and related documents what anybody will know about this incident will be the batf version with the way our government is i wouldn t doubt it the batf has just been given carte blanche for further abuses with the effective support and approval of the administration clinton said on the news that he knew about what was happening but that it was all in the hands of the fbi that is if you choose to believe the media there will be more abuses with no concern of administration censure the precident has been established that the feds can kill in quantity to achieve their aims especially if the target is excercising their rights under the second amendment and the rest of the bill of rights and is a government declared un nice fellow if they had rocket launchers and such as the press and gov claims why shouldn t they have done something what possible use would a religious cult have for a rocket launcher also is child abuse covered by the bill of rights lls and clams will be pleased dung tsow ping sp will be pleased saddam hussein sp will be pleased idi amin would be pleased stalin would be pleased even hitler would be pleased any self respecting despot would nod and say well done bill clinton well then there are probably a lot of self respecting despots in the us cause i m sure they feel the same way god bless america land of the free past tense well maybe i am overreacting but i see on the tv as i am typing where maybe maybe not there are a lot of questions that should be raised about this incident the problem is who will do it and be heard govt spoksewoman the new attorney general known to be almost rabid about private ownership of guns wants to ban assault guns and just about everything else is saying the fbi had amazing restraint then falls back into the official goverenment line about how the bd were guity of child abuse and were into it in an on going basis and so on note that according to the liberal elite giving a child a spanking is regarded as child abuse seriously if it gets known the state can take your child away from you if you spank your kid she also is saying which state is that the federal government or an individual state government clinton personally approved this operation she told him it was appropriate and so on and he said ok do it somehow i am not surprised the people must know who is boss who is in charge and it is obviouly no longer the people it seems to me that the people haven t been in charge for a long time if they really were i don t think the government would be doing as many things as it has in the past and i maintain the appropriate response as far as this raid by batf is concerned regarding child abuse is so what batf are not our child protective services police yet after all the bd had been tried on that charge before and found not guilty the gov t people have pretty much gone silent on the terrible illegal guns bd supposedly has and stress the continued child abuse apparantly to make it a seem as sort of a rescue operation figuring everyone hates child abusers and anything is ok to use against them occasional references to ammunition possesed by the bds and so on is irrelevant it is not illegal to have ammunition yet true but is it illegal to have a rocket launcher am i having a vain hope that an honest investigation will occur on this thing or will it simply be whitewashed under the rug and business as usual will continue to be the order of the day in the new order who will be given the official title of thought police i wonder and if clinton and friends have their way highly likely at this point the new order government will also have all the guns so what if is going to be ten years late i think we are going to discover that we will be paying dearly for putting this fellow in office for decades to come even some die hard supporters are having serious doubts about their savior shit if people dont get what they want right away there is an instant problem clinton has only been in office for a few months give him a chance to get something done the guy had a lot of shit thrown in his lap in the beginning give him a chance to work on things a little as they say rome wasn t built in a day yes i am upset i see no good as far as civil individual rights to come of any of his proposals decisions for the last month or so we have really been had or bill of rights is now nothing but a quaint curiosity i highly doubt that it is that bad yet how about the rodney king trial the two people who were most responsible got the axe how bad the axe falls tho is yet to be

4402###talk.politics.guns###re proper gun control what is proper gun control was re my gun is like my american express card iftccu talk politics guns mikey ccwf cc utexas edu strider pm apr i think most of us would rather be held up with a knife than with a gun but how the hell are you going to manage that you still haven t offered i ve been watching this knife verses gun bit for a while now even contributed a few comments but this stuff i d rather face a knife than a gun has got to come from ignorance i used to think pretty much the same thing then i got educated people do not as a rule understand how deadly knives can be or how quickly you can be killed with one most people don t understand that it takes less than an inch of penetration in some areas to cause quick within a minute or so death the death rates from handguns and knives are within a few percentage points of each other many people not realizing how deadly knives are try their luck and thus more get injured by knives a gun is deadly only in a single direction and it s only advantage is that it is a remote control weapon a contact weapon such as a knife controls a spherical area to feet in diameter most people have never seen knife wounds aside from slicing a finger by accident from feet or so a knife is very nearly an even match for a holstered gun in experienced hands even if the knife wielder has only moderate skill from inside feet or so a knife is a match for a drawn gun a knife is utterly silent it never jams and never runs out of ammunition it is limited only by the speed dexterity skill and ability of it s wielder criminals in general are young fast and strong it s interesting to note that the patterned slashing attacks used by many martial artists remarkably resemble the wild uncontrolled slashing attacks of novices i ve talked to several well trained martial artists they have unanimously agreed that if they ever go up against a knife they simply plan on being cut hopefully not as bad as the attacker practicing with firearms requires facilities and equipment practicing with knives requires only a small area and something to simulate a knife say a popsicle stick or tooth brush criminals practice their knife attacks in prison if you have not trained against knives with a firearm and do not realize these facts the first inkling you will have that something is wrong is the knife ripping through your throat or in the case of an experienced attacker parts of your body falling off onto the ground a year old man with arthritis can close that yard distance and gut you in about one and a half seconds dennis tueller with a broken leg in a walking cast managed it in two i ve seen people close that distance and strike in second i m old over weight and slow i can do it in seconds i ve seen morgue footage of people killed with edged weapons that you would not believe how about a single stab wound to the chest with a table fork in this case the attacker used the handle not the pointed end add to this the fact that hand gun stopping power is largely a myth except in the case of a central nervous system shot or a round that destroys the skeletal structure it takes anywhere from to twelve seconds for a bullet wound to take effect this is true of even heart shots there is the case of the police woman in l a the first recorded survivor of a shot to the heart that lady not only killed her attacker but chased him down to do it all four of her shots fired after she had been shot struck the perp atta girl the bullet entered her on a downward angle went through the apex of her heart down through the diaphragm clipped her liver and destroyed her spleen it then exited her back leaving a tennis ball sized hole she died about six times on the operating table but was out of the hospital in days and was back on full duty in eight months she was off duty at the time and not wearing her vest she was on her way home so happened to have her gun no she doesn t think civilians should have the same rights sigh the moral of the story is that even if you do manage to shoot a knife attacker you d better be planning on doing some dodging a good alternative is to shoot for and break the pelvis people can often walk a little on broken legs but a broken pelvis will nearly always anchor them many firearms schools recommend pelvis shots against

4035###sci.electronics###re what do nuclear site s cooling towers do nagle netcom com john nagle writes great explaination however you left off one detail why do you always see them at nuclear plants but not always at fossil fuel plants at nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle whereas fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot water as i recall the water isn t as hot thermodynamically in many fossil fuel plants and of course there is less danger of radioactive contamination actually the reasons you don t see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are fossil units multiple units per plant are generally smaller than nuclear plants mwe seemed to be a very popular size when many fossil plants were built the average nuclear plant is mwe many fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were adopted why those old dirt burners can t harm anything let em go powered draft cooling towers low enough to the ground to be generally not visible from off site are quite popular with fossil plants fossil plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears actually fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual boiling water reactor nuclear plants there s a gripe in the industry that nuclear power uses vintage steam technology so it s more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system as cold as possible hence big cooling towers oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers but they usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water not most of the way down to ambient some plants do cool the condensers with water rather than air as one canadian official asked about thermal pollution de icing a river said up here we view heat as a resource actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants of similar size the issues are the same regardless of where the heat comes from condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine the condenser pressure is normally water s vapor pressure at the condensing temperature it is desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity causes erosion of the condenser tubes the coldest and thus lowest pressure condensing environment is always the best a related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell where the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes since the condenser is at a very low pressure the only force driving the condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity if the condensate is too hot or the gravity head is too low the condensate will reflash into steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate this is a particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all costs the hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps how much lower they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in the hotwell typically hotwell temperatures run between and degrees depending on the temperature of the river water this term is used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water is pumped when the river water temperature is high in the summer operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order to provide more gravity head there is a tradeoff involved since higher hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the condenser area at least in the east and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the air the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge water from the cooling towers the temperature of the discharge water from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and humidity it is very rare in the east to hear of actual river water temperatures exceeding degrees a vast difference from the typical days degrees humidity we see routinely in the east it is not unusual particularly where the econazis have been successful in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant for the plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive pressure everybody runs closed cycle boilers the water used is purified of solids which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when the water boils purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than cooling it so the boiler water is recycled true actually secondary plant the part that makes electricity and feeds feedwater to the boiler water chemistry has been the bastard stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves the plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood the costs of impure water by impure i mean water with a few dozen extra micromho of conductivity and or a few ppm of dissolved oxygen secondary water is now typically the most pure one will find outside the laboratory john john de armond wd oqc

4585###talk.politics.guns###weird science by l neil smith posted by cathy smith for l neil smith weird science everyone knows how to tell when a politician is lying his lips move what may not be equally obvious is that there are politicians and then there are politicians and that the phrase political science is subject to more than one interpretation years ago we heard how scientists were worried that a new ice age might be coming and later on that nuclear winter smoke and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full scale international unpleasantness was a possibility something like that may even have killed the dinosaurs what we didn t hear was that no actual data supported any of this that real world events the burning of kuwaiti oil fields tended to discredit it that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken values that made america the most successful culture in history and that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the plague when continents drifted together exposing them to new germs we miss a lot like this unless we listen closely prince william sound site of the famous oil spill and mount st helen s weren t supposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least years that turned out not to be true although you d never know it from watching network nightly news or cnn it doesn t fit their agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient and that nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be but for once the media aren t entirely to blame as ignorant of science as they are of everything they trust scientists to unscrew the inscrutable the trouble is that today s scientists have agendas of their own nobody in government that wellspring of scientific wherewithal is going to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that there is no respectable evidence for global warming the money and power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit and they hate the automobile blamed as a major cause of the mythical crisis as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable the same appears true of acid rain a deliberate hoax cooked up by the environmental protection agency which hates private industrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car and foisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on specialists in different fields not talking to each other much the list goes on always with a common disreputable thread ozone depletion for which evidence is even more suspect and contradictory than for acid rain or global warming is no more than a last desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era when state central planning and the command economy have failed and can only find this final withered leg to teeter on decades of anti nuclear alarmism resting on foundations of myth and panic mongering have failed to erase the fact that nuclear power is the safest cleanest most efficient source of energy known to mankind and more to the point that the greater amount of energy there is available to any individual in society the freer that individual and his society become honest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and self defense on crime conducted by investigators who began as ideological opponents to those concepts but which show massive reductions in the latter to be the result of the former have been suppressed most recently by the california state government and what the media didn t say about recent epa discoveries on the effect of secondhand smoking is that although some harm to non smokers may have been detected it was less by an order or two of magnitude than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a week or keeping a pet bird it s enough to make you wonder whether there was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer that of course is the real threat represented by politically correct science the world is a dangerous place it would be nice to know the hazards i ve never believed smoking to be a healthy practice but given a lack of credibility on the part of today s science how am i to decide what to do about it nicotine is highly addictive to that much i can attest from experience yet the stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue there isn t any way to tell thanks to the corrupting influence of government money on the scientific establishment two centuries ago the founding fathers spared us certain agonies to which every other nation in the world has been subject at one time or another by creating a legal barrier between politics and religion each time some short sighted individual or group has tried to lower the barrier most recently over the issue of abortion blood real human blood hot and smoking in the street has wound up being shed real human blood is being shed over scientific issues as people s lives are ruined through the loss to agencies like the epa of livelihood or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate to diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels for electrical power or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates when they die from the effects of obesity what we need now if we hope to survive as a civilization for two more centuries is another barrier a constitutional separation of state and science including medicine knowledge is valuable real science won t languish for lack of funding the

particularly from diverse sources imho if the government didn t have anything to hide they would have allowed cameras near the compound from the beginning i agree i saw no reason they could not have had close in pool cameras manned by volunteers and protected by sandbags or whatever points made by dick degueran koresh s lawyer the tanks were not pumping cs gas but were ejecting exploding canisters from the tank booms that penetrated multiple walls before exploding okay their word against the fbi s at this point see ya in court the tanks were collapsing interior walls and ceilings putting people at great risk dear dear they could have come out the construction of the coupound used almost all used materials that were very dry and bails of hay were stacked against the walls as shields against the government s bullets okay they were living in a fire hazard that they built said that previous to the invasion there were no military drills and that the supplies they had on hand were for survival no crime irrelevant either way their gas masks worked so well that many members were having bible study and some were sleeping when the fire was set ah yes that is exactly what i would do hold bible study take a nap always a wise course of action when you re being gassed there was no group instruction of any kind from koresh or his aids after the tank invasion referring to any kind of suicide pact or counter assault efforts i don t believe there was a suicide pact i believe that koresh wanted a fiery conflagration which he may not have told his followers in fact this hypothesis is confirmed by the survivors stories everyone had moved to the center of the compound in order to escape the falling debris from the tank invasion when the fire was set yes that s right and once the whole compound was demolished where did they expect to go women and children who has sought shelter on the second floor from the tanks were trapped by doors jammed by the tanks ramming the building and distorting the frames the building is being rammed and they are going upstairs that s almost as bad as running into a fire hallways ran the length of the buildings that acted as conduits for the fire and trapped almost everyone in place his experts have told him that this horizonal chimney effect is what made the fire appear to have started at several places at once hm an interesting notion we ll see koresh was not seen the last hour before the fire and was assumed to be in his th floor room with some of his children more bible study no doubt hey it s a priority the texas medical examiner has stated flatly that none of the bodies recovered so far had bullet wounds directly contradicting the fbi s lies actually on friday he stated that there was no evidence either way and he could not flatly contradict the federal agents claims we ll know more later in any event it s irrelevant the survivors unanimously stated that if the victims could have gotten out they would have that they were trapped by the tank destroyed building and the speed of the fire for six hours they were trapped the building was not destroyed immediately they could have left at any time the underground bunker cited by the fbi as the place koresh could have put the children had he not been a cold blooded killer had been blocked by the tanks crashing down debris on top of the access door six hours to move it away or come out dick said that he had sat in koresh s bedroom talking to him and had observed that his room was furnished like all the rest and without air condition or other luxuries directly contradicting the fbi s claim that he lived in splendor irrelevant anyway pr one way or the other but no crime or innocence indicated dick saw bullet holes in koresh s room made from the outside in which indicates the batf was indiscriminately shooting down through the roof no word on whether they were being fired back at which is an operative question here the fire was probably started by the tanks knocking over coleman lanterns that were lit and sitting on a piano next to the wall the tanks busted through though none of the survivors saw the fire start right for six hours you know that a tank could come thru the wall at any point and you leave a coleman lantern burning near bales of hay every one of the survivors strongly denies ever saying anything to the fbi about starting the fire hearing someone say the fire was lit or any of the other stuff attributed to them by the fbi it s ultimately irrelevant who lit the fire they had ample opportunity to leave he said when he first met koresh in the compound he expected to find a raving lunatic but instead found a rational charming and intelligent young man and was very surprised by that fact most charismatic leaders are extremely intelligent actually they tend to be excellent actors and skilled manipulators ex ted bundy koresh had no drugs stronger than aspirin to use against pain medical assistance was jsut a phone call away gee all he had to do was come out women with children had their own bedrooms for them and their kids that were appointed as nicely as koresh s not relevant to any crimes dick said he saw signs of home schooling for the kids and at no time did he ever see any signs of abuse while he was there anyway outsiders rarely see abuse it s a secretive thing all we have to go on are the court documents in the jewell case and the mistrial in california no one was ever held against their wills and could have left at any time the people who were murdered in the fire were there by their own choices exactly by their own choice he called for an independent prosecutor if ever there were a need for one this is it looks like there will be several investigations starting with congressional committee hearings next week his closing comments were they don t look upon themselves as a cult they view themselves as highly religious people they sincerely believe what they believe and who am you or i to judge that as wrong his last sentence says it all who the hell are we or the government to judge their religion as wrong this event i hope will be recorded in history as the american holocaust these people were murdered by the us government just as surely as the jews were by the nazis i hang my head in shame for what i ve allowed my government to become i have never judged them by their religion but by their actions if they had lived a quiet religious life as they claimed there would have been no raid no siege and no deaths instead they chose courses of action at every turn that were at the very least stupid if not irrational the first was to stockpile weapons the second was to shoot federal agents the third was to stay inside just as we don t blame a cop who shoots a kid who had pointed a toy weapon at him i don t think the fbi deserves blame in this case the koresh cult standoff is over may his victims recquiescat in pace the above is a

myname mysite to specify your correct e mail address to reply to what is jpeg jpeg pronounced jay peg is a standardized image compression mechanism jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard jpeg is designed for compressing either full color or gray scale digital images of natural real world scenes it does not work so well on non realistic images such as cartoons or line drawings jpeg does not handle black and white bit per pixel images nor does it handle motion picture compression standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees named jbig and mpeg respectively jpeg is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn t quite identical to what you originally put in the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details aren t perceived as well as small details of light and dark thus jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans if you plan to machine analyze your images the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality you can make extremely small files if you don t mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc conversely if you aren t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression why use jpeg there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store bit per pixel color data instead of bit per pixel data making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images being able to compress a mbyte full color file down to kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time if you are comparing gif and jpeg the size ratio is more like four to one more details below if your viewing software doesn t support jpeg directly you ll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images even with a jpeg capable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance thus using jpeg is essentially a time space tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply it s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file i ll let you do the arithmetic yourself the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information bits pixel million colors instead of or less or fewer colors if you have only bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you within a couple of years though bit gif will look as obsolete as black and white macpaint format does today furthermore for reasons detailed in section jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif jpeg is not going to displace gif entirely for some types of images gif is superior in image quality file size or both one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to as a rule of thumb jpeg is superior to gif for storing full color or gray scale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and similar material jpeg is superior even if you don t have bit display hardware and it is a lot superior if you do see section for details gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings in particular large areas of pixels that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif jpeg can t squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects this sort of image is best kept in gif form in particular single color borders are quite cheap in gif files but they should be avoided in jpeg files jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pure black pixels adjacent to a row of pure white pixels for example sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in gif files borders overlaid text etc the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that s only a few pixels high if you have a gif with a lot of small size overlaid text don t jpeg it computer drawn images ray traced scenes for instance usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity the more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same goes for semi realistic artwork fantasy drawings and such plain black and white two level images should never be converted to jpeg you need at least about gray levels before jpeg is useful for gray scale images it should also be noted that gif is lossless for gray scale images of up to levels while jpeg is not if you have an existing library of gif images you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg you will lose a little image quality if you do section which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif only applies if both formats start from a full color original if you start from a gif you ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information jpeg can only make things worse however the disk space savings may justify converting anyway this is a decision you ll have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section for hints be prepared to leave some images in gif format since some gifs will not convert well how well does jpeg compress images pretty darn well here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy a x full color image of a ship in a harbor the first three files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section b file size in bytes comments ship ppm original file in ppm format no compression bits or bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead ship ppm z ppm file passed through unix compress compress doesn t accomplish a lot you ll note other text oriented compressors give similar results ship gif converted to gif with ppmquant fs ppmtogif most of the savings is the result of losing color info gif saves bits pixel not see sec ship jpg cjpeg q highest useful quality setting this is indistinguishable from the bit original at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs ship jpg cjpeg q default setting you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original even with both on screen at once ship jpg cjpeg q this has slight defects if you know what to look for you could tell it s been jpeged without seeing the original still as good image quality as many recent postings in usenet pictures groups ship jpg cjpeg q jpeg s characteristic blockiness becomes apparent at this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some still i ve seen plenty of usenet postings that were of poorer image quality than this ship jpg o cjpeg q optimize optimize cuts table overhead blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or indexing purposes note that this file is tiny the compression ratio from the original is in this case jpeg can make a file that s a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality the q file is every bit as good as the gif better if you have a full color display this seems to be a typical ratio for real world scenes what are good quality settings for jpeg most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings quality does not mean keep of the information as some have claimed the quality scale is purely arbitrary it s not a percentage of anything the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb the default quality setting q is very often the best choice this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image try q first if you see defects then go up except for experimental purposes never go above q saying q will produce a file two or three times as large as q but of hardly any better quality if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to q without objectionable degradation on the other hand you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg the default q is about right for compressing bit images but q to is usually better for converting gifs see section for more info if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are prepared to tolerate large defects a q setting in the range of to is about right q or so may be amusing as op art note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section b and to many programs based on it other jpeg implementations such as image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale some programs don t even provide a numeric scale just high medium low style choices where can i get jpeg software most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp if you don t know how to use ftp see the faq article how to find sources if you don t have direct access to ftp read about ftpmail servers in the same article that article appears regularly in news answers or you can get it by sending e mail to mail server rtfm mit edu with send usenet news answers finding sources in the body the anonymous ftp list faq may also be helpful it s usenet news answers ftp list faq in the news answers archive note this list changes constantly if you have a copy more than a couple months old get the latest jpeg faq from the news answers archive a if you are looking for canned software viewers etc the first part of this list is system specific programs that only run on one kind of system if you don t see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet but some commercial programs are listed too x windows john bradley s free xv version and up is an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and other image formats it s available for ftp from export lcs mit edu or ftp cis upenn edu the file is called xv tar z where is the version number currently it is located in the contrib directory on export or the pub xv directory at upenn xv reduces all images to bits internally which means it s not a real good choice if you have a bit display you ll still get only bit color also you shouldn t use xv to convert full color images to jpeg because they ll get color quantized first but xv is a fine tool for converting gif and other bit images to jpeg caution there is a glitch in versions and earlier be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a jpeg file or the file will be blurry another good choice for x windows is john cristy s free imagemagick package also available from export lcs mit edu file contrib imagemagick tar z this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks the imagemagick viewer handles bit displays correctly for colormapped displays it does better though slower color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software both of the above are large complex packages if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release xloadimage is free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib xloadimage tar z xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg files because it has the ijg v decoder while xloadimage is using a hacked over v the next xloadimage release will fix this xli is also free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib xli tar z both programs are said to do the right thing with bit displays ms dos this covers plain dos for windows or os programs see the next headings one good choice is eric praetzel s free dvpeg which views jpeg and gif files the current version a is available by ftp from sunee uwaterloo ca file pub jpeg viewers dvpeg a zip this is a good basic viewer that works on either or machines the user interface is not flashy but it s functional another freeware jpeg gif tga viewer is mohammad rezaei s hiview the current version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics hv zip hiview requires a or better cpu and a vcpi compatible memory manager qemm and max work windows and os do not hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen for larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen rather than using panning scrolling as most viewers do you may or may not prefer this approach but there s no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably note installation is a bit tricky read the directions carefully a shareware alternative is colorview for dos this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives its user interface is also much spiffier looking although personally i find it harder to use more keystrokes inconsistent behavior it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview at least on my hardware for images larger than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than hiview the current version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics dcview zip requires a vesa graphics driver if you don t have one look in vesadrv zip or vesa tsr zip from the same directory many recent pcs have a built in vesa driver so don t try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing a second shareware alternative is fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but i don t know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel archives at that time the well known gif viewer compushow cshow supports jpeg in its latest revision a however cshow s jpeg implementation isn t very good it s slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is poor except on hi color displays too bad it d have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow shareware available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos gif cshw a zip due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine if you can t get any of them to work you ll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif then view with your favorite gif viewer if you have hi color hardware don t use gif as the intermediate format try to find a targa capable viewer instead vpic is reputed to do the right thing with hi color displays the independent jpeg group s free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics jpeg zip or jpeg zip if you have a and extended memory these files are dos compilations of the free source code described in section b they will convert jpeg to and from gif targa and ppm formats handmade software offers free jpeg gif conversion tools gif jpg jpg gif these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format in particular you can t get bit color output from a jpeg the major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsi s proprietary jpeg format as well as the usenet standard jfif format since hsi format files are rather widespread on bbses this is a useful capability version of these tools is free prior versions were shareware get it from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics gif jpg zip note do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet since it is not readable on non pc platforms handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package image alchemy this will translate jpeg files both jfif and hsi formats to and from many other image formats it can also display images a demo version of image alchemy version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics alch zip note about simtel the internet s key archive

windows system overhead note that you can run the dos conversion programs described above inside a windows dos window the newest entry is winecj which is free and extremely fast version is available from ftp rahul net file pub bryanw pc jpeg wecj zip requires windows and or more colors mode this is a no frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers but it s so fast you ll use it anyway at least for previewing jview is freeware fairly fast has good on line help and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format but it can t create new jpeg files and it doesn t view gifs jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but it s an excellent basic viewer the current version is available from ftp cica indiana edu file pub pc win desktop jview zip mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites including wuarchive wustl edu winjpeg shareware displays jpeg gif targa tiff and bmp image files it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter it has some other nifty features including color balance adjustment and slideshow the current version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note above file msdos windows winjp zip this is a slow compatible version if you register you ll get the only version which is roughly faster colorview is another shareware entry this was an early and promising contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it has no real advantages over winjpeg if you want to try it anyway the current version is available from ftp cica indiana edu file pub pc win desktop cview zip i understand that a new version will be

shareware macintosh most mac jpeg programs rely on apple s jpeg implementation which is part of the quicktime system extension so you need to have quicktime installed to use quicktime you need a or better cpu and you need to be running system or later if you re running system you must also install the bit quickdraw extension this is built in on system you can get quicktime by ftp from ftp apple com file dts mac quicktime quicktime hqx as of this file contains quicktime which is better than qt in several ways with respect to jpeg it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file however some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt mac users should keep in mind that quicktime s jpeg format pict jpeg is not the same as the usenet standard jfif jpeg format see section for details if you post images on usenet make sure they are in jfif format most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format the first choice is probably jpegview a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format pict jpeg format or gif format it also can convert between the two jpeg formats the current version is a big improvement over prior versions get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app jpeg view hqx requires system and quicktime on bit displays jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers in fact it s the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over x pixels on a typical mb mac given a large image jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers you can zoom in on any desired portion though some people like this behavior some don t overall jpegview s user interface is very well thought out gifconverter a shareware image viewer converter supports jfif and pict jpeg as well as gif and several other image formats the latest version is get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac art gif gif converter hqx requires system or later gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeg gif viewer but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images also the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images without quicktime so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime but it s faster with quicktime note if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert then viewing the gif version jpeg convert a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities is available from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app jpeg convert hqx this will run on any mac but it only does file conversion not viewing you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v a jpeg gif converter based on an old version of the ijg code if you are using this program you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert apple s free program pictpixie can view images in jfif quicktime jpeg and gif format and can convert between these formats you can get pictpixie from ftp apple com file dts mac quicktime qt stuff pictpixie hqx requires quicktime pictpixie was intended as a developer s tool and it s really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface worse pictpixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix there is an old version of pictpixie called pictcompressor floating around the net if you have this you should trash it as it s even buggier also the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleaned up descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net storm technology s picture decompress is a free jpeg viewer converter this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without system or quicktime so you may be forced to use it on older systems it does need bit quickdraw so really old machines can t use it you can get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app picture decompress hqx you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to jpeg to allow picture decompress to open it if your machine is too old to run bit quickdraw a mac plus for instance gifconverter is your only choice for single program jpeg viewing if you don t want to pay for gifconverter use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg although not all can deal with the usenet

contribute to improving our software you are welcome to join what s all this hoopla about color quantization most people don t have full color bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware stores or fewer bits per pixel so it can display or fewer distinct colors at a time to display a full color image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors this process is called color quantization this is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term we re stuck with the standard usage though clearly color quantization is a lossy process it turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings since jpeg is a full color format converting a color jpeg image for display on bit or less hardware requires color quantization this is true for all color jpegs even if you feed a or less color gif into jpeg what comes out of the decompressor is not colors but thousands of colors this happens because jpeg s lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray scale output incidentally because of this effect it s nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences i occasionally see posted images described as color jpeg this tells me that the poster a hasn t read this faq and b probably converted the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classified as color or gray scale just like photographs but number of colors just isn t a useful concept for jpeg on the other hand a gif image by definition has already been quantized to or fewer colors a gif does have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format doesn t allow more than palette entries for purposes of usenet picture distribution gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients don t have to this is also the disadvantage of gif you re stuck with the sender s quantization if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to re quantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full color image furthermore if the sender didn t use a high quality color quantization algorithm you re out of luck for this reason jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don t match the sender s display hardware jpeg s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user s display hardware furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of jpeg images you already have with a gif you re stuck forevermore with what was sent it s also worth mentioning that many gif viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines if you view a color gif on a color ega display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations one to create the gif one to display it but often it s also due to sloppiness jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed thus jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for low color resolution displays as well as high resolution ones finally an ever growing number of people have better than bit display hardware already bit hi color pc displays true bit displays on workstations and macintoshes etc for these people gif is already obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively thus jpeg is an all around better choice than gif for representing images in a machine independent fashion how does jpeg work the buzz words to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding this article s long enough already so i m not going to say more than that here for technical information see the comp compression faq this is available from the news answers archive at rtfm mit edu in files pub usenet news answers compression faq part if you need help in using the news answers archive see the top of this article what about lossless jpeg there s a great deal of confusion on this subject the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm i e one that guarantees the final output is bit for bit identical to the original input however this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offers much less compression at present very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist and all of them are commercial saying q to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step with the v free jpeg code you can also say sample x to turn off subsampling keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value it s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image at this minimum loss setting regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed bit per pixel image true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bit for bit accuracy if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with or more bits per pixel furthermore jpeg is public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents why all the argument about file formats strictly speaking jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms it does not refer to a specific image file format the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations since we can t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem in the absence of official standards a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs aren t compatible with anybody else s the closest thing we have to a de facto standard jpeg format is some work that s been coordinated by people at c cube microsystems they have defined two jpeg based file formats jfif jpeg file interchange format a low end format that transports pixels and not much else tiff jpeg aka tiff an extension of the aldus tiff format tiff is a high end format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides tiff is a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets of tiff it s not likely that adding jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpeg related products it s reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the tiff spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details even when tiff jpeg is well defined the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator tiff jpeg files may never be as transportable a particular case that people may be interested in is apple s quicktime software for the macintosh quicktime uses a jfif compatible format wrapped inside the mac specific pict structure conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward and several mac programs are available to do it see mac portion of section a if you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section for details another particular case is handmade software s programs gif jpg jpg gif and image alchemy these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi this format is not readable by any non hsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings use the j switch to get jfif output this applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif format by default you still should be careful not to post hsi format files unless you want to get flamed by people on non pc platforms how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software won t read it s likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg based format you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file a jfif standard file will start with the characters hex ff d ff e followed by two variable bytes often hex followed by jfif if you see ff d at the start but not the rest of it you may have a raw jpeg file this is probably decodable as is by jfif software it s worth a try anyway hsi files start with hsi you re out of luck unless you have hsi software portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they won t decompress properly with non hsi programs a macintosh pict file if jpeg compressed will have a couple hundred bytes of header followed by a jfif header scan for jfif strip off everything before the ff d and you should be able to read it anything else it s a proprietary format or not jpeg at all if you are lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d try stripping off everything before that in uuencoded usenet postings the characteristic jfif pattern is begin line m c x whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with begin line m i if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non jfif files what about arithmetic coding the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed the choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file on typical images arithmetic coding produces a file or percent smaller than huffman coding all the file size numbers previously cited are for huffman coding unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm at t and mitsubishi thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses from these companies the fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best at least in the short run i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding the space savings isn t great enough to justify the potential legal hassles in particular arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future stay tuned for further details does loss accumulate with repeated compression decompression it would be nice if having compressed an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially unfortunately this is not the case in general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without changing it then there is no further loss i e you get an identical jpeg file even this is not true at least not with the current free jpeg software it s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first generation output it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change one of the things on our to do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but i am not optimistic about it in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full color output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff error degradation if you re wondering why it s because the pixel block boundaries move if you cropped off only multiples of pixels you might be safe but that s a mighty limited capability the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you don t want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while working on the image then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compression decompression time this way what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg as stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg if you can obtain the original full color data the gif was made from it s far better to make a jpeg from that but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding gif that will give you a chance to re do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary some gifs may be better left as gifs as explained in section in particular cartoon type gifs with sixteen or fewer colors don t convert well you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be larger than the gif so check the sizes too experience to date suggests that large high visual quality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to jpeg with least degradation don t waste your time converting any gif much under kbytes also don t expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from full color originals to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight through jpeg files would be i e shoot for or rd the size of the gif file not th as suggested in earlier comparisons many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant color border around a gif image while useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files it is not free in jpeg files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging if you are on an x windows system xv s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this cjpeg s default q setting of is appropriate for full color input but for gif inputs q settings of to often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation if you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher q setting may not be necessary color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the colors that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value the trouble with dithering is that to jpeg it looks like high spatial frequency color noise and jpeg can t compress noise very well the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you had it to get around this you want to smooth the gif image before compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a better looking output image than you d get without smoothing with the v free jpeg software or products based on it a simple smoothing capability is built in try smooth or so when converting gifs values of to seem to work well for high quality gifs heavy handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors if you can see regular fine scale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you don t want if you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package however cjpeg s built in smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol the upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality smooth is probably a good starting point for converting gifs but if you really care about the image you ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings for more information about jpeg in general or the free

in item below all of the packages mentioned can do some form of gray to b w conversion rotating a raster image by an arbitrary angle the obvious but wrong method is to loop over the pixels in the source image transform each coordinate and copy the pixel to the destination this is wrong because it leaves holes in the destination instead loop over the pixels in the destination image apply the reverse transformation to the coordinates and copy that pixel from the source this method is quite general and can be used for any one to one d mapping not just rotation you can add anti aliasing by doing sub pixel sampling however there is a much faster method with antialising included which involves doing three shear operations the method was originally created for the im raster toolkit see

macdraw to cgm or whatever it is important to understand that this is a very different problem from the image format conversions in item converting one image format to another is a fairly easy problem since once you get past all the file header junk a pixel is a pixel the basic objects are the same for all image formats this is not so for vector formats the basic objects circles ellipses drop shadowed pattern filled round cornered rectangles etc vary from one format to another except in extremely restricted cases it is simply not possible to do a one to one conversion between vector formats there is software for converting to and from cgm files on ftp psc edu the contributor states that it runs on unix ms windows and possibly the mac a better more specific blurb would be most welcome on the other hand it is quite possible to do a close approximation rendering an image from one format using the primitives from another as far as i know no one has put together a general toolkit of such converters but two different hpgl to postscript converters have been posted to comp sources misc check the index on your nearest archive site a related frequent question is how to convert from some vector format to a bitmapped image from postscript to sun raster format or hpgl to x bitmap for example some of the commercial postscript clones for pc s allow you to render to a disk file as well as a printer also the postscript interpreters in the next box and in sun s x news can be used to render to a file if you re clever but in general the answer is no however if someone were to put together a vector to vector conversion toolkit adding a vector to raster converter would be trivial gnu ghostscript from the fsf current version includes drivers for both ppm and gif format files thus it can be used as a postscript to ppm or a postscript to gif filter it implements essentially all of postscript level and alot of display postscript and level how to get pixar films

back cover of the case it cannot be rented how do i draw a circle as a bezier or b spline curve the short answer is you can t unless you use a rational spline you can only approximate a circle the approximation may look acceptable but it is sensitive to scale magnify the scale and the error of approximation magnifies deviations from circularity that were not visible in the small can become glaring in the large if you want to do the job right consult the article a menagerie of rational b spline circles by leslie piegl and wayne tiller in ieee computer graphics and applications volume

a planar polygon consider a ray originating at the point of interest and continuing to infinity if it crosses an odd number of polygon edges along the way the point is within the polygon if the ray crosses an even number of edges the point is either outside the polygon or within an interior hole formed from intersecting polygon edges this idea is known in the trade as the jordan curve theorem see eric haines article in glassner s ray tracing book above for more information including treatment of special cases another method is to sum the absolute angles from the point to all the vertices on the polygon if the sum is pi the point is inside if the sum is the point is outside however this method is about an order of magnitude slower than the previous method because evaluating the trigonometric functions is usually quite costly code for both methods plus barycentric triangle testing can be found in the ray tracing news vol no available from princeton edu pub graphics rtnews

210###comp.graphics###re xv problems in article apr nessie mcc ac uk c c lilley mcc ac uk writes in article rohjc avt cc tut fi jk lehtori cc tut fi kouhia juhana writes i wrote something about making color modifications quickly with bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the bit image this makes sense because the main use of xv is only viewing images doing many changes to image we should keep all modifications in a buffer and then before making the operations to bit image we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations think about what you are saying here the bit image is quantised down to bits so many similar colours are mapped onto a single palette colour this colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways you then want to apply these modifications back to the bit file so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette colour i suppose you don t know what about we have discussed we discussed about error s in xv which shows images only as bit and my suggestion above works perfectly with it so far i have seen a colormap editing window in xv that is there must be a colormap anyway the problems you present are exist anyway and i didn t tried to solve them at all because i would not make such problems to my programs in the first place gamma and color corrections are easily done to bit image as i presented there s no need make tricks from bit quantized image back to bit image how would you suggest doing colour editing on a bit file how would you group related colours to edit them together only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more complicated ok you re writing about situation that user want edit images as bit and user want edit individual colors your questions by the way jumps off the discussion a bit my solution doesn t work because there s no colormap withing real bit image you see user see bit image going back to bit is silly about changing individual colors in bit quantized rasterized image changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the image xv allows this feature but i don t recommend to use it with the mentioned type images moreover xv is not a paint program you can only make those global changes in full bit xv changing individual colors sounds like paint program job if person have bit screen there s need for tricks to get the original bit image modified because user don t see full bit image there s need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups if image is rasterized to select indiavidual color there could be x cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area selecting individual color is possible from that ok i don t have thought very much bit painting programs never seen such in good view and are not planned to make such not to mention bit painting program in bit screen yes again what is was wrong with xv it saved bit quantized rasterized images as bit jpegs jpeg is not designed for that also human expect that bit will be saved as bit image say person would like to crop part of the image and save it then it is expected that the image still is the same so xv were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work design error i have heard xv were designed first for bit images files but it were not good idea to take full bit images without making major change to the original design so even all screen images are bit the processed images and saved images could have been bit very easily instead of bit before anybody will make a note yes i may as well make a lift where up means that the lift goes down and down means that the lift goes up and put a note on this design solution to the manuals however even the manuals tells the correct situation it doesn t solve the problem americans the lift is just an example well my text may be a bit hard reading hopefully you suggeeded to read it juhana kouhia

3580###rec.motorcycles###st ride sixteen days i had put off test driving the honda st finally the th was a saturday without much rain in fact it cleared up became warm and sunny and the wind died about three weeks ago i took a long cool ride on the hawk down to cycles for a test ride they had sold and delivered the demo st about fifteen hours before i arrived and the demo vfr was bike locked in the showroom surrounded by other bikes and not likely to move soon today was different there were even more bikes used dirt bikes used street bikes cars and a big tent full of outlandishly fat touring bikes with trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot some sort of fat bike convention shelly and dave were running one msf course each at the same time one in the classroom and one on the back lot plus there was the usuall free cookout food that cycles gives away every weekend in the summer hmmm it seemed like a big moto party after about ten minutes of looking for rob c cheif of sales slime and another minutes reading and signing a long disclosure libility pray to god form i helped jt push the st out into the mess in the parking lot we went over the the controls i put the tank bag from the hawk into the right saddlebag and my wife put everything else into the left saddlebag thats nice having helped push the st out to the lot i thought it best to have jt move it to the edge of the road away from the bikes and people he rode it like a bicycle it cant be that heavy i thought well i was wrong as i sat on the st both feet down all i could think was big then i put one foot up heavy came to mind very quickly with cindy on the back was she on the back hard to tell with seat three times as large as a hawk seat the bike seemed nearly out of control just idling on the side of the road by rpm in second gear all the weight seemed to dissappear even on bike with miles on the odometer slippery new tires and pads that did not yet bite the disks things seems smooth and sure cycles is on a section of that few folks ever ride about miles north of the computer concentration about five miles north of where i splits away is a lighly travelled two lane limited access highway it goes through heavily forested sections of hamilton manchester by the sea and newbury on its way to gloucester on its way there it meets a road that winds from the sea about miles inland to andover on its way it goes through many thoroughly new england spots perfect if slow sport touring sections cindy has no difficulty with speed rd gear th gear purring along in top gear this thing has less low rpm grunt that my hawk lane changes were a new experience a big heft is required to move this thing responds well though no wallowing or complaint behind the fairing it was fairly quiet but the helmet buffeting was non trivial top gear car passing at mph was nearly effortless smooth smooth smooth not sure what the v sound reminds me of but it is pleasant if only the bars were not transmitting an endless buzz the jump on to caused me to be less than impressed with the brakes its a down hill reversing camber twice reversing radius decreasing radius turn a real squeeze is needed on the front binder the section of we were on was tight but too urban the st works ok in this section but it shows its weight we went by the clam shack oft featured in spencer for hire a place where you could really find spencer his house was about miles down after putting through traffic for a while we turned and went back to about half way through the onramp i yanked cindy s wrist our singal for hold on tight head check left time to find redline second gear gives a good shove third too fourth sees dod speed with a short shift into top on the way to we saw no cops and very light traffic did not cross into dod zone because the bike was too new well now it had miles on it so it was ok tried some high effort lane changes some wide sweeping turns time to wick it up i went until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat and stayed there when i was comfortable with the wind and the steering i looked down to find an indicated mph not bad for up touring beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit at the get off in a mile sign i rolled off the throttle and coasted i wanted to re adjust to the coming slowness it was a good idea there were several manhole sized patches of sand on the exit ramp back to the slow and heavy behavior cycles is about a mile from i could see even more cars stacked up outside right when i got off i managed to thread the st through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad out front heavy it took way too much effort for cindy and i to put the thing on the center stand i am sure that if i used the side stand the st would have been on its side within a minute my demo opinion heavy put it on a diet smooth comfortable hardly notices the dod speed i d buy on for about less than list just like it is too much for the bike as it is frank evan

2223###comp.graphics###outlining of spline surface about a year ago i started work on a problem that appeared to be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult i am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and hopefully some published solutions to it the problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines for inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional i e only extant between the edges but which exists in three dimensional space to draw the object we fit a cubic spline through the points each spline is effectively computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the curve each spline has an equal number of segments we assume that the nth segment along each spline is roughly but not exactly the same distance along each spline by any reasonable measure take each segment n along each spline and match it to the nth segment of the opposing spline use the pair of segments to form two triangles which will be filled in to color the surface depth sort the triangles take each triangle in sorted order project onto a d pixmap draw and color the triangle take the edge of the triangle that is along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge colored with a special edge color it is the edge coloring in step that is at the heart of the problem the idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface the net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface the reasons for this are fairly complicated they involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines if anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area thanks

over a month thus unless your site s news software is ill mannered this posting should always be available this witdodfaq is crossposted to all four rec motorcycles groups in an attempt to catch most new users and followups are directed to rec motorcycles last changed feb to add a message from the kotl and a bit of halon version this collection was originally assembled by lissa shoun from the original postings with lissa s permission i have usurped the title of kotwitdodfaq any corrections additions bribes etc should be aimed at blgardne javelin sim es com contents how do i get a dod

by ed green dod and others how do i get a dod number if the most frequently asked question in rec motorcycles is what is the dod then the second most frequently asked question must be how do i get a dod number that is as simple as asking the keeper of the list kotl accept no substitue keepers for a number if you re feeling creative and your favorite number hasn t been taken already you can make a request subject to kotl approval warning non numeric non base number requests are likely to earn a flame from the kotl not that you won t get it but you will pay for it oh and just one little tiny suggestion ask the kotl in e mail you ll just be playing the lightning rod for flames if you post to the whole net and you ll look like a clueless newbie too by now you re probably asking so who s the kotl already well as john sloan notes below that s about the only real secret left around here but a few un subtle hints can be divulged first it is not myself nor anyone mentioned by name in this posting maybe though john was the original kotl second in keeping with the true spirit of unix the kotl s first name is only two letters long and can be spelled entirely with hexadecimal characters the kotl shares his name with a line oriented text utility third he has occasionally been seen posting messages bestowing new dod numbers mostly to boneheads with weenie mailers fourth there is reason to suspect the kotl of being a dead head newsflash a message from the kotl once you have surmounted this intellectual pinnacle and electronically groveled to the kotl please keep in mind that the kotl does indeed work for a living and occasionally must pacify its boss by getting something done your request may languish in mailer queue for gasp days perhaps even horrors a week or two during such times of economic activity on the part of the kotl s employers sending yet another copy of your request will not speed processing of the queue it just makes it longer verification of this phenominon is left as an excersize for the reader if you suspect mailer problems at least annotate subsequent requests with an indication that a former request was submitted lest you be assigned multiple numbers what you think the kotl memorizes the list one more thing the kotl says that its telepathic powers aren t what they used to be so provide some information for the list will ya the typical dod list entry contains number name state country e mail address for example ed green ca ed green east sun com ps while john mentions below that net access and a bike are the only requirements for dod membership that s not strictly true these days as there are a number of denizens who lack one or both blaine dances with bikers gardner blgardne javelin sim es com denizens of doom by bruce tanner dod road rider august reprinted with bruce s permission there is a group of motorcyclists that gets together and does all the normal things that a bunch of bikers do they discuss motorcycles and motorcycling beverages cleaning fluids baklavah balaclava caltrops helmets anti fog shields spine protectors aerodynamics three angle valve seats bird hits deer whistles good restaurants racing philosophy traffic laws tickets corrosion control personalities puns double entendres culture absence of culture first rides and friendship they argue with each other and plan rides together the difference between this group and your local motorcycle club is that although they get together just about everyday most have never seen each other face to face the members of this group live all over the known world and communicate with each other electronically via computer the computers range from laptops to multi million dollar computer centers the people range from college and university students to high tech industry professionals to public access electronic bulletin board users currently rec motorcycles pronounced wreck dot motorcycles it s the file name for the group s primary on line meeting place carries about articles per month it is read by an estimated people most of the frequent posters belong to a motorcycle club the denizens of doom usually referred to as the dod the dod started when motorcyclist john r nickerson wrote a couple of parodies designed to poke fun at motorcycle stereotypes fellow computer enthusiast bruce robinson posted these articles under the pen name denizen of doom a while later chuck rogers signed off as dod nr keeper of the flame bruce was then designated dod nr retroactively and of course nickerson the originator of the parodies was given dod nr the idea of a motorcycle club with no organization no meetings and no rules appealed to many so john sloan dod nr became keeper of the list issuing dod numbers to anyone who wanted one to date there have been almost memberships issued to people all over the united states and canada as well as australia new zealand the united kingdom france germany norway and finland keeper of the list sloan eventually designed a club patch the initial run of patches sold out immediately the profits from this went to the american motorcycle heritage foundation another amhf fund raiser selling denizens of doom pins to members was started by arnie skurow a few months later again the project was successful and the profits were donated to the foundation so far the denizens have contributed over to the ama museum a plaque in the name of the denizens of doom now hangs in the motorcycle heritage museum as often as possible the dod ers crawl out from behind their crts and go riding together it turns out that the two largest concentrations of dod ers are centered near denver boulder colorado and in california s silicon valley consequently two major events are the annual assault on rollins pass in colorado and the northern versus southern california joust the ride and feed is a bike trip over rollins pass followed by a big barbecue dinner the concept for the joust is to have riders from northern california ride south riders from southern california to ride north meeting at a predesignated site somewhere in the middle an additional plan for is to hold an official denizens of doom homecoming in conjunction with the ama heritage homecoming in columbus ohio in july though it s a safe bet the the denizens of doom and their collective communications hub rec motorcycles will not replace the more traditional motorcycle organizations for those who prowl the electronic pathways in search of two wheeled camaraderie it s a great way for kindred spirits to get together long may they flame live to flame flame to live centerbar this official motto of the denizens of doom refers to the ease with which you can gratuitously insult someone electronically when you would not do anything like that face to face these insults are known as flames issuing them is called flaming flames often start when a member disagrees with something another member has posted over the network a typical sophisticated intelligent form of calm reasoned rebuttal would be something like what an incredibly stupid statement you spandex clad poseur this will guarantee that five other people will reply in defense of the original poster describing just what they think of you your riding ability and your cat the denizens of doom the saga unfolds by john sloan dod periodically the question what is dod is raised this is one of those questions in the same class as why is the sky blue if there is a god why is there so much suffering in the world and why do women inevitably tell you that you re such a nice guy just before they dump you the kinds of questions steeped in mysticism tradition and philosophy questions that have inspired research and discussion by philosophers in locker rooms motorcycle service bays and in the halls of academe for generations a long long time ago in computer time where anything over a few minutes is an eternity and the halting problem really is a problem on a computer far far away on the net topologically speaking two machines in the same room in atlanta might route mail to one another via a system in chicago a chap who wished to remain anonymous but who was eventually assigned the dod membership wrote a satire of the various personalities and flame wars of rec motorcycles and signed it the denizen of doom not wishing to identify himself he asked that stalwart individual who would in the fullness of time become dod to post it for him dod not really giving a whit about what other people thought and generally being a right thinking individual did so flaming and other amusements followed he who would become the holder of dod membership thought this was the funniest thing he d seen in a while being the sort that is pretty easily amused so he claimed membership in the denizens of doom motorcycle club and started signing his postings with his membership number perhaps readers of rec motorcycles were struck with the vision of a motorcycle club with no dues no rules no restrictions as to brand or make or model or national origin of motorcycle a club organized electronically it may well be that readers were yearning to become a part of something that would provide them with a greater identity a gestalt personality something in which the whole was greater than the sum of its parts it could also be that we re all computer nerds who wear black socks and sneakers and pocket protectors who just happen to also love taking risks on machines with awesome power to weight ratios social outcasts who saw a clique that would finally be open minded enough to accept us as members in a clear case of self fulfilling prophesy the denizens of doom motorcycle club was born a club in which the majority of members have never met one another face to face and perhaps like it that way yet feel that they know one another pretty well or well enough given some of the electronic personalities in the newsgroup a club organized and run in the loosest sense of the word by volunteers through the network via electronic news and mail with a membership mailing list often used to organize group rides amongst members who live in the same region a motto a logo a series of photo albums circulating around the country organized by dod club patches organized by and even an mtv style music video produced by and distributed on vhs by where will it end who knows will the dod start sanctioning races placing limits on the memory and clock rate of the on board engine management computers will the dod organize poker runs where each participant collects a hand of hardware and software reference cards will the dod have a rally in which the attendees demand a terminal room and at least a sized unix system only time will tell the dod has no dues no rules and no requirements other than net access and a love for motorcycles to become a member one need only ask although we will admit that who you must ask is one of the few really good club secrets new members will receive via email a membership number and the latest copy of the membership list which includes name state and email address the denizens of doom motorcycle club will live

viewer discretion is advised script for the denizens of doom anthem video by jonathan e quist dod scene a sterile engineering office a lone figure whom we ll call chuck stands by a printer output bin wearing a white cdc lab coat with mechanical pencils in a pocket protector editor s note for some reason a great deal of amusement was had at the first annual dod uni coastal ironhorse ride joust by denizens referring to each other as chuck i guess you had to be there i wasn t chuck i didn t want to be a software systems analyst cow towing to the whims of a machine and saying yessir nosir may i have another sir my mother made me do it i wanted to live a man s life music slowly builds in background riding nortons and triumphs through the highest mountain passes and the deepest valleys living the life of a motorcyclist doing donuts and evading the police terrorizing old ladies and raping small children eating small dogs for tea and large dogs for dinner in short i want to be a denizen chuck rips off his lab coat revealing black leather jacket with fringe boots and cap scene simultaneously changes to the top of an obviously assaulted rollins pass a small throng of hell s angels sit on their harleys in the near background gunning their engines showering lookers on with nails as they turn donuts and leaking oil on the tarmac chuck is standing in front of a heavily chromed fat boy chuck sings to the tune of the lumberjack song i m a denizen and i m okay i flame all night and i ride all day hell s angels echo chorus surprisingly heavy on tenors he s a denizen and he s okay he flames all night and he rides all day i ride my bike i eat my lunch i go to the lavat ry on wednesdays i ride skyline running children down with glee chorus he rides his bike he eats his lunch he goes

ck but like a real good sh t oh i m a denizen and i m okay i flame all night and i ride all day chorus refrain oh he s a denizen i wear high heels and bright pink shorts full leathers and a bra i wish i rode a harley just like my dear mama chorus refrain why you have to be killed well the first thing you have to understand just in case you managed to read this far and still not figure it out is that the dod started as a joke and in the words of one denizen it intends to remain one sometime in the far distant past a hapless newbie asked what does dod stand for it s not the department of defense is it naturally a denizen who had watched the movie top gun a few times too many rose to the occasion and replied that s classified we could tell you but then we d have to kill you and the rest is history a variation on the security theme is to supply disinformation about what dod stands for notable contributions and contributers where known include daughters of democracy dod doers of donuts dancers of despair dod debasers of daughters dickweeds of denver driveway of death debauchers of donuts dumpers of dirtbikes note that this is not a comprehensive list as variations appear to be limited only by the contents of one s imagination or dictionary file the rec moto photo archive first a bit of history this all started with ilana stern and chuck rogers organizing a rec motorcycles photo album many copies were made and several sets were sent on tours around the world only to vanish in unknown locations then bruce tanner decided that it would be appropriate for an electronic medium to have an electronic photo album bruce has not only provided the disk space and ftp e mail access but he has taken the time to scan most of the photos that are available from the archive not only can you see what all these folks look like you can also gawk at their motorcycles a few non photo files are available from the server too they include the dod membership list the dod yellow pages the general rec motorcycles faq and this faq posting here are a couple of excerpts from from messages bruce posted about how to use the archive via ftp cerritos edu via e mail the address is server cerritos edu the commands are given in the body of the message the current commands are dir and send given one per line the arguments to the commands are vms style file specifications for rec moto photo the file spec is dod file for example you can send dir dod send dod bruce tanner gif send dod dodframe ps and you ll get back mail messages a directory listing uuencoded parts of bruce tanner gif and the dodframe ps file in ascii oh wildcards are allowed but a maximum of mail messages rounded up to the next whole file are send a send dod gif would send files of k each not a good idea bruce tanner x tanner cerritos edu cerritos college norwalk ca cerritos tanner a couple of comments bruce has put quite a bit of effort into this so why not drop him a note if you find the rec moto photo archive useful second since bruce has provided the server as a favor it would be kind of you to access it after normal working hours california time patches what patches you may have heard mention of various dod trinkets such as patches pins and your reaction was probably i want or that s sick or perhaps that s sick i want well there s some good news and some bad news the good news is that there s been an amazing variety of dod labeled widgets created the bad news is that there isn t anywhere you can buy any of them this isn t because of any exclusivity attempt but simply because there is no dod store that keeps a stock all of the creations have been done by individual denizens out of their own pockets the typical procedure is someone says i m thinking of having a dod frammitz made they ll cost xx xx with xx xx going to the ama museum anyone want one then orders are taken and a batch of frammitzes large enough to cover the pre paid orders is produced and quickly consumed so if you want a dod doodad act quickly the next time somebody decides to do one or produce one yourself if you see a void that needs filling after all this is anarchy in action here s a possibly

4293###talk.politics.guns###re gun control was re we re mad as hell at the tv news jim de arras jmd cube handheld com wrote last year the us suffered almost wrongful or accidental deaths by handguns alone fbi statistics in the same year the uk suffered such deaths scotland yard statistics the population of the uk is about that of the us weighted for population the us has x as many handgun related deaths as the uk and no the brits don t make up for this by murdering x as many people with baseball bats you just can t compare this way all homicides must be shown per capita not just handguns the availability of them in the usa makes them the preferred murder weapon but ban them and some other weapon will step in as the favorite as a favorite sure as lethal not likely a study of violence in chicago produced this table percentage of reported gun and knife attacks resulting in death weapon deaths as percentage of attacks knives total attacks guns total attacks source firearms and violence in american life it might be contended that if gun murderers were deprived of guns that they would find a way to kill as often with knives if this were so knife attacks in cities where guns were widely used in homicide would be expected to show a low fatality rate and knife attacks in cities where guns were not so widely used like vancouver would show a higher fatality rate but the nat l commission on the causes and prevention of violence task force analyzed the data and found this not to be the case it appeared to them that as the number of knife attacks increased in relation to the number of firearms attacks which presumably happened where guns were less available to assailants the proportion of fatal knife attacks did not increase relative to the proportion of gun attacks in fact the reverse was true what was found was that most homicides did not show a determination on the part of the assailant to kill fatalities caused by knife tended to show a single mindedness on the part of the assailant to do grave physical injury multiple stabs wounds wounds concentrated about the head neck and chest etc most gun homicides did not show this pattern rather more fatal attacks were committed during a moment of rage and not the focused intent to kill the victim source report on firearms and violence then since england usa my ancestors left because of the oppression you must compare england before strict gun laws to england after strict gun laws to be able to draw any meaning at all england has essentially legalized drugs so there are no drug gangs battling for turf etc there if you drop out the drug related killings here the usa would look a whole lot more peaceful there are a lot of factors which make a difference actually i m not fond of making any kind of social parallels between europeans and americans there are more cultural beahvioral and economic differences between us than similarities i just sort of found myself backed into that corner over the last couple of weeks i don t think we could ever attain the low levels of european violent crime here in the us whether we banned guns or required every law abiding citizen to carry a loaded uzi on the other hand we can draw lessons from neighbors who are more culturally similar namely the canadians in fact an exhaustive seven year study has already been done of the respective crime rates of vancouver british columbia and seattle washington cities with roughly the same population urban economy geography and crime but with decidedly different approaches to gun control in seattle handguns may be purchased legally for self defense after a day waiting period a permit can be obtained to carry a concealed weapon the recreational use of handguns is minimally restricted in vancouver self defense is not considered a valid or legal reason to purchase a handgun concealed weapons are not permitted recreational uses of handguns target shooting collecting are regulated by the province purchase of a handgun requires a restricted weapons permit a permit to carry may be obtained in order to transport the weapon to licensed shooting clubs handguns transported by vehicle must be stored in the trunk in a locked box in short gun control but not unreasonably so both cities aggressively enforce their gun laws convictions for gun related offenses carry similar penalties the researchers studied all cases of robbery assault simple and aggravated burglary and homicides occurring in seattle and vancouver from to in defining the cases they used the same standard the fbi s unified crime report results during the seven year study the annual rate of robbery in seattle was found to be only slightly higher than that in vancouver burglaries occurred at nearly identical rates assaults were recorded in seattle versus in vancouver the risk of being a victim of a simple assault in seattle was found to be only slightly higher than vancouver and the risk of aggravated assault was also slightly higher however when aggravated assaults were subdivided by weapon and the mechanism of assault a clear pattern emerged although both cities reported nearly identical rates of aggravated assault involving knives and other dangerous weapons firearms were far more likely to be used in seattle in fact times as often over the seven year study homicides occurred in seattle per vs homicides in vancouver per after adjustment for differences in age and sex among the populations the relative risk of being a victim of homicide in seattle as compared to vancouver was found to be when homicides were subdivided by the mechanism of death the rate of homicide by knives and other weapons excluding firearms in seattle was found to be almost identical to that in vancouver virtually all of the increased risk of death in seattle was due to a more than fivefold higher rate of homicide by firearms handguns accounted for roughly of homicides involving firearms handguns were times more likely to be used in homicides in seattle than in vancouver the authors of the report also investigated legally justifiable homicides self defense only such homicides occurred during the seven year study of which were committed by police only cases of civilians acting in self defense occurrred in seattle and in vancouver only involved firearms after excluding these cases there was virtually no impact on these earlier findings this is i feel a very fair report one might even make the argument that it is biased against canada as a whole because vancouver reports annual rates of homicide two to three times that of ottawa calgary and toronto while seattle reports annual homicide rates only half to two thirds that of nyc chicago los angeles and houston critics of handgun control always argue that limited legal access to handguns will have little effect on the rates of homicide because persons intent on killing others will only try harder to acquire a gun or will kill by other means this report shows differently if the rate of homicide in a community were influenced more by the strength of intent than by the availability of weapons we could expect the rate of homicides by weapons other than guns to be higher in vancouver than in seattle however during the study interval vancouver s rate of homicide by weapons other than guns was not significantly higher than that in seattle suggesting that few would be assailants switched to homicide by other methods as well ready access to handguns for self defense by law abiding citizens was not endorsed in this report although seattle did experience a higher rate of firearm death for self defense these cases accounted for less than of the homicides in both cities during the course of the study period and as was reported seattle apparently didn t enjoy relief from any crime category over vancouver because citizens may legally arm themselves for self defense heavily quoted source handgun regulation crime assaults and homicide

4509###talk.politics.guns###re my gun is like my american express card in article cmm thomasp surt ifi uio no thomas parsli thomasp ifi uio no writes overall crime rate it fell just like that two questions when was this and do you have the relevant numbers please note this is not in any way an indication i don t believe you or that you re not correct but when the drop occured is relevant acquiring weapons in norway you can buy almost all kinds of weapons in norway but you must have a permit and a good reason to get the permit if i would like to have a handgun i would have to get an gun licence from the police and to be a member of a gun club the primary objection beyond ones based on the ideal of rkba that it is simply not something the government should do is that it makes guns a play thing and tool of the rich and connected it discriminates against the poor is self defense considered appropriate and if so under what conditions are you allowed for instance to get a gun for protection if you re going to be carrying a very large sum of money on a regular basis or have been threatened the police would check my criminal records for any serious crimes and or records of serious mental diseases this has been suggested in the u s and generally supported among gun owners what many object to is that many if not most proposals contain a sort of gotcha clause which allows an arbitrary denial even if you qualify in every way now if a got my licence i would have to be an active member of the gun club for months before i could collect my gun it s a little like getting a drivers licence isn t it you have to prove that you can drive before you are allowed to at this point it should be pointed out that in general a driver s licence in the u s is for the most part nothing like its european counterpart i understand getting one is far more difficult there than here in the u s it s a joke but my usual objection is that you re discussing two different things for instance in the u s a driver s license is a permit to operate a motor vehicle on a public road it is not necessary to own one or to operate it on private property that is the ability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise from the government s legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations for behavior on public lands a permit to own an automobile for instance which is far closer an analogy would be a much harder thing to get past legally since it wouldn t be based on making regulations on public property but in restricting activity on private property use of guns in crimes in norway some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners arms for a long time but these are rather the exeption most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes and mostly short time befor the crime use of knives it is allowed to cary knifes in public but not in your belt or open you americans think it s ok to have a gun but not to carry it open in public rigth this varies widely one thing i think europeans have a difficult time with is that the u s has fifty unique jurisdictions where the laws from one state to another can be as radically different as from one country in europe to another some places allow open carry of both guns and knives some allow concealed some prohibit both or allow one or the other and it can be either a state or local restriciton individual vs masses yes the individual is more important than the masses but only to some extent your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses what happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of all the others the question must be asked is the right of this individual affecting the rights of this other individual what we usually get is that the rights of this group meaning some individuals within this group here defined as people who own guns are adversely affecting the rights of some other group if for instance bob were using his gun to attack steve you d have a point but essentially what we re discussing is that becuase some person who qualifies as a member of the group people who own guns then some third person perhaps in another time zone is told that their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else s rights it s like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited by one the issue i believe the issue is guns and gun legislation the issue is crime violence and murder the question is to what extent guns and gun legislation impact those we shouldn t mix weapons and items that can serve as one if i lived in amerika i would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in home but should it have to be like that of course not it would be nice if we didn t have to fear that other people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us but currently we don t have that option nor do i expect we will do you think it s wise to sell guns like candy some states do no state does in any case there s a limit to which the state may enforce it s wisdom on me freedom in general is an unwise concept if you pre emptively restrict everything which might be unwise then freedom becomes a meaningless concept if you believe it s smart neccacery to have drivers licence why do you think it should be free to buy guns i ll raise my hand against driver s licenses as currently implemented they re a waste of time and little more than revanue generation for the state and ignored by a startling number of drivers it does not guarantee a level of skill any higher than is necessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebody else killed or a knowledge of traffic laws beyond what any ten year old will have picked up riding around in his parents car but as i mentioned they re two different things david veal univ of

chicago on gun control and other civil rights rkba archive general information and anonymous ftp instructions the moderator of the firearms politics mailing list karl kleinpaste has agreed to set up an anonymous ftp archive directory for rkba related information this directory can be used for things like articles by kates wright tonso levinson supreme court decisions the ria vs us decision copies of legislation and so on it s not meant to be for the discussions that normally appear here so in the future if you re looking for something check there first and then ask here instructions short version for techies the site is godiva nectar cs cmu edu place contributions into the directory usr anon pub firearms politics rkba the ftp commands get put mget or mput should work give the command type binary to be sure files are transferred correctly your files will be moved to the rkba directory to get a file use the commands get or mget i will maintain an index which you should get first to check if the file you want to read or write already is archived long version for non techies in order for you to use this archive your computer must be on the internet to connect to the archive site run the command ftp godiva nectar cs cmu edu if that doesn t work you cannot use this archive if the ftp command is successful you ll get this prompt asking you for a login name godiva nectar cs cmu edu lvc instead of lvc your initials will appear answer this prompt with ftp next you ll get this prompt asking your for your e mail address guest login ok send e mail address as password i would enter l v cipriani att com you ll enter your own e mail address you ll get these lines or similar as output remote system is unix using binary mode to transfer files next the command prompt is printed ftp if you do not get the line using binary mode to transfer files run the command type binary now you re logged in to the archive machine there are many directories on this machine but the two you are concerned with are usr anon pub firearms politics rkba and usr anon pub firearms politics incoming there are subdirectories to the rkba directory those are discussed below when you login to the system your directory is usr anon to retreive files change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command cd usr anon pub firearms politics rkba or cd pub firearms politics rkba to submit files change your directory to the incoming directory with the command cd usr anon pub firearms politics incoming or cd pub firearms politics incoming once you do this you ll get another ftp prompt asking you to enter another command to find the names of the existing files in the directory you are in run the command ls l this will produce something like total r r r karl jun dmn gratia ccp r r r karl apr index r r r karl jun knox aw lies r r r karl apr s r r r karl jun wsj crimestrike r r r karl jan academia bias r r r karl mar academics r r r karl aug aclu and so on each line corresponds to one file reading right to left the fields are the file name the last modification date of the file the size of the file in bytes and some permission fields which you do not need to be concerned with to get a file run the command get followed by the name of the file you want for example get index or get noduty after the file is transfered to your machine a message like this transfer complete bytes received in seconds kbytes s you can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive you can use the mget command to retreive multiple files if the file you want is in a subdirectory for example congress rd hr you should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first and then retrieve it cd congress rd get hr once you re finished you can log off with the command quit if you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little different first of all you should find out if the file already exists so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above and look it over to make sure you wouldn t repeat an entry the index will have a description of each of the files in the rkba directory for example file whitemanslaw white man s law by william r tonso from the december reason magazine once you ve determined you won t be duplicating an entry login and change to the incoming directory command see above once you are in the incoming directory use the command put file name in this case put whitemanslaw again there ll be a transfer complete so many bytes transfered in so many seconds message now your file is on the archive machine another thing to watch out for is duplicate file names be sure there isn t a file in the incoming directory that is called the same as the file you want to write if you use the same name you ll overwrite the previous file or you ll get an error message your file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a file by the same name in the rkba directory once your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for the index file and i will add it to the file if you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute a file email the file to me and i ll take care of the rest if you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed so be sure to let me know first if you have any questions feel free to ask me larry cipriani l v cipriani att com michael phelps

1793###talk.politics.guns###dealing with cults a few thoughts in the wake of the waco denouement i had email discussions with people from this group in particular we discussed how cults operate why the fbi might be motivated to black out news or behave the way it did and what kinds of problems are involved in dealing with cults and similar organizations i include an edited account of what i wrote the identity of my correspondents have i hope been erased the editing process makes the text choppy sorry about that i ve tried to retain the information content ellipses indicate where text was removed a few of the comments in parentheses are new intended to make it easier for outsiders to understand these notes are preliminary feel free to criticize cheers oded begin included text i took a course called the madness of crowds the course included cults and briefly mentioned analyzed jonestown did some external reading too william adorno edited a series of books on the psychology of evil mass movements starting with the authoritarian personality university of chicago press an attempt to figure out what would motivate people to support fascism or be the bad guys in wwii and by extension in other wars in racial lynchings i don t think the books are perfect and the study of psychopathology has advanced but you can elicit koresh types from even the first volume so i think they re onto something how cult psychology works i m an amateur hope i m not hopelessly naive so long as koresh could own his people he made sure they didn t believe there was any life out there for them away from him otherwise he d koresh be nothing during the siege ex davidians recounted how he convinced the people in the compound they survived only through his intercession with god to spare their worthless souls absolutely classic brainwashing technique as long as they believed him they d ignore batf fbi child protective services or even the red cross asking them to come out after all if they ever left him god would catapult them straight to hell and the combined forces of the us gummint with all the goodwill in the world doubtful couldn t save them for a second if i believed it i d stay and die too like the folks in jonestown for a prosaic analogy replace a cult leader with an estranged wife or husband and notice how many folks show up kill the ex and then themselves that s the consequence of shattered cultism it really does happen all the time by the way the treasured ideal in such cases without which life is meaningless is the relationship no matter how abusive rather than the individual s partner why no news don t the feds owe the world an explanation i agree that official explanations are in order i can also see good reasons for news blackouts the only fact available is that had the fbi not acted yesterday those people would be alive today that no matter what those people would have died because koresh made sure they believed they had no lives outside his influence hence it would make little difference when or how the fbi acted he held them hostage as his trump against going to jail but nothing would really stop him from offing them even if the fbi went away look at history rep leo ryan and some staffers visited jonestown at the request of constituents who had relatives there once jonestown was discovered and even though they killed ryan and his entourage they all killed themselves because jim jones knew he d be busted internal arguments asking to spare the children brought up by some of the women in the cult were shouted down there are tapes the logic of saying that no matter how bad the gummint is it wouldn t kill the kids was shouted down as blasphemy and the people who brought it up were threatened with ostracism by people who by their own avowal would be dead within the hour i suspect it s the same with the branch davidians there s a book on jonestown by james reston jr titled our father who art in hell i don t know whether it s good never read it the only way to prevent such a problem would be never to investigate reports of child abuse or sexual mistreatment or organizations buying full auto conversion kits or shipping hand grenades via ups on the off chance of stumbling across cults that would kill themselves so the only way the batf fbi could save those people and future cults is by ignoring such signs i suppose there s another way outsmarting koresh and tricking him into letting them go or somehow influencing his people to abandon him while he owns most of their means of communication with the world a mighty tough row to hoe i suspect the fbi tried to do that with blackouts noise and other sensory insults however maybe they re not very sophisticated or maybe the job is impossible it s certainly possible the guy running the show was a jerk why the fbi might want to blackout during and coverup after if they were doing a poor job of weaning the bd s from koresh they d want to keep it quiet so they wouldn t be embarrassed if they were trying to wean the bd s from koresh they d want to keep it quiet so he couldn t outflank them or well meaning boneheads from any point of view wouldn t screw it up i hate playing chess when the world screams in my face especially if at checkmate time people really die and i could be blamed i don t think ignoring such incidents is a workable policy unless you deny the fbi batf child protective services of whatever stripe and the rest of the gummint should exist at all the end okay have at it

1466###sci.electronics###re lead acid batteries part the lead acid secondary cell releases energy electricity with the following chemical reaction pb pbo h so pbso h lead and lead iv oxide and sulfuric acid produce lead sulfate and water heats of formation deleted the heat of reaction at c is therefore kcal per mole pbso produced note that lead sulfate is not very soluble grams per grams water at c and it will thus precipitate out of solution where the reaction is occurring or the cathode positive terminal of the battery i am almost sure it is the positive terminal where the precipitate forms but i may be wrong oh well i don t have a corroded battery to corrobate and i don t feel like thinking through it right now the major problem with this is that the reaction takes place in an acid solution pbso is soluble in an acid solution and will not precipitate out also h so is in a water solution as h and so thus the heats of formation of pbso and h so are for the most part irrelevant what is important to notice here is that the reaction as you knew it would be is exothermic or energy discharging as it turns out the reaction is indeed exothermic heat producing more about this later what actually happens to make the battery completely useless is this we re talking lead acid batteries of course the battery slowly self discharges as this discharge takes place two things happen the level of pb ions in the acid solution increases i e the lead and lead oxide plates are dissolved the level of h ions in the acid solution decreases i e the solution becomes less acidic or more like water if you like now as the post to which i am responding correctly stated pbso will precipitate in a water non acid solution when the battery dies i e is fully discharged we end up with a high concentration of pb and so in water so pbso forms in the solution and falls to the bottom of the battery of course this happens in varying degrees the more discharged the more precipitate forms the precipitate forms a conductive layer on the bottom of the battery if there is enough of the lead and lead oxide plates left to touch the precipitate more common in a newer battery a dead short results i have seen products in automotive shops to correct this condition but they are for the most part useless they can dissolve the pbso but cannot restore the lead and lead oxide plates properly you may have some success with these products for a newer battery stuff deleted to understand why lead acid batteries do indeed discharge faster when stored on concrete as opposed to wood or earth dirt one should recall lechatelier s principle which can be paraphrased as anything subjected to some stress will act to move to a more comfortable position here are the thermal conductivities of a some selected materials stuff deleted this is where lechatelier s principle comes into play removing energy from the exothermic reaction will drive the reaction further to completion if the reaction normally occurs at room temperature keeping the battery at that temperature requires the removal of any heat produced a concrete surface is a better heat sink than a dirt or wood surface store a battery in the corner of a poured concrete basement and you have surfaces removing energy which pulls the reaction along this stuff is just made up by the author and is completely invalid in fact the discharge reaction takes place at a higher rate at higher temperatures a logical consequence of the above argument is this if you really want your car to start lower the battery temperature to to pull the reaction along we all know from experience at least those of us in canada do it gets cold up here that this is not true if we want to start our car on a really cold day we warm the battery besides which there is not enough energy released through self discharge to appreciably raise the temperature the air would amply dissipate any such heat whether the bottom of the battery was insulated or not this is of course irrelevant since you would want the battery to be cool during storage just keep the battery in a cool dry place and keep it charged

4692###talk.politics.guns###re some more about gun control first i would like to say how much i appreciate having so literate and erudite an individual as mr rutledge with whom to discuss this topic frankly most anti rkba posters refuse even to approach the topic of the original understanding of the bill of rights as detailed in the writings of the era this is most refreshing second i must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days my brigade s quarterly drill was this weekend and i needed to attend to several matters pertaining to the state militia some people seem to feel that the concept of the militia is an anachro nism that is out of place in the th century i m not sure the swiss would agree and i think perhaps a discussion of how the militia both organized and unorganized fits into the defense plans of my state mississippi please do not assume that this describes something peculiar to one southern state for instance the commonwealth of massachusetts has a well organized militia which members report maintains stocks of both riot guns and machine guns the laws of other states will vary but are probably similar title of mississippi code defines our militia as all able bodied citizens of the state between the ages of seventeen and sixty two years the militia is divided into classes the national guard the mississippi state guard and the unorganized militia the national guard is a strange sort of fish from a constitutional perspective it tries to be both state militia and federal reserve the discussion of this para constitutional arrangement is quite interesting in itself but somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion suffice it that at this date the national guard has ceased to have any constitutional standing as anything but a federal reserve force mississippi and most other states maintains a purely state organized militia in mississippi this is called the state guard in other states it may be called something else the state guard exists as a cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers and senior ncos who serve as volunteers without compensation we drill on a monthly basis at the company and battalion level brigade once a quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization our state authorized cadre strength is this is a skeleton of an organization without any flesh the muscle and sinew when needed will come from the unorganized militia in time of invasion insurrection or calamity the governor can order the activation of the state guard when this takes place a call will first be made for volunteers to fill the organization out to either its contingency strength of or full strength of in the event that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer the law provides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of the unorganized militia the size of the state guard is not specified by law but rather by executive order at one time the organized militia of mississippi consisted of regiments needless to say the state does not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip such a force the historical precedent for arming such a force is by use of mostly the private arms of the militiamen it is my hope that demonstrates that state militias are far from being the long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim no i simple stated that the people have a right to join a well organized militia and i have also stated that a militia that meets once or twice a year is clearly well organized and this state of readiness that i have claimed the people have a right to is the same state of readiness expected of the militia as stated by hamilton regarding hamilton if you take hamilton s opinion as being the sole representative of the opinions of the founding fathers you will have chosen a highly skewed sample set hamilton was on the extreme federalist end of the political spectrum others such as coxe and henry can be chosen to represent the other end many contemporaries felt that the idea of having a standing army of any sort or even a select militia or train bands were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern ment they were striving to perfect the compromise reached was to provide for a small army which had to be refinanced every two years and iron clad protection for the militia which was to remain ever terrible and irresistible these protections included state control not federal limitation of federal utilization of the militia i e execute laws suppress insurrections and repel invasions and the right to keep and bear arms to prevent what the british had tried to do at lexington these limitations eventually proved so onerous to the federal govern ment that they were skirted by the creation of the national guard the national guard was created for one very simple reason the constitutional militia was had proved too unreliable for fighting wars of imperial expansion e g spanish american war the constitution provided that the militia could only be employed by the federal government in very limited purposes as far back as the war of militia units had refused to leave united states territory to attack the enemy further there was no constitutional authorization for any conscription of anyone into the federal military and militiamen were particularly protected in all wars until ww i every american who left the country under arms was a volunteer when the national guard acts of required that each new member also enlist as a reservest in the army existing soldiers were grandfathered at least one of these grandfathered individuals refused to go to france in and his refusal was upheld by the federal courts mr rutledge has stated that the second amendment applies only to members of a well organized militia however the pre constitutional history of the american militia shows relatively few periods when the militia came close to meeting either messrs rutledge or hamilton s definition of well organized in the period of peace between the french indian war and the revolution many companies simply stopped drilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to the revolution perhaps mr rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestors who answered the lexington alarm had forfeited their rights because their units didn t drill for a few years in the s i would not be so bold again i wish to repeat the national guard for all its merits is not the militia described by the constitution nor by mr hamilton nor by mr henry nor by mr coxe the fact that the federal government and many states are delinquent in their attentions to and organizing of their constitutional militias diminishes neither their responsibilities nor the rights of the militia as detailed in the constitution misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the militia is but one error that has crept into modern readings of the constitution the constitution prohibits states from keeping troops or ships of war in time of peace i have heard some insist this prevents states from maintaining a militia but this comes about because people today do not understand the meanings of the words in their th century usage today we call any large vessel a ship but in the th century the word described a particular kind of vessel a ship is a large vessel with three or more masts each carrying square rigged sails a brig has two masts in the contemporary usage the states were prohibited only from keeping the largest warships of the day those capable of global operations today s equivalent might be a prohibition on the states keeping nuclear missiles troops at this time meant a full time professional military organization any study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out in at least one respect i am in agreement with mr rutledge being personally involved in the maintenance and advancement of the militia as a viable means of defense for a modern society i am frequently both bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic on their place in the unorganized militia and become strangely silent or scarce when invited to attend a drill of their state s militia

that david koresh and members of the branch davidians possessed over in firearms and ammunition did david koresh and the members of the branch davidians have a valid federal firearms license were they actively participating in the legal business of selling buying firearms and ammunition and were any of the weapons they had illegally possessed does this paper evidence consist only of weapons purchased or does it include legally dispossessed weapons after the original assault on the compound tragically failed a batf spokeswoman stated we were outgunned yet tv newscasts of video tape filmed at the time of the incident show batf agents armed with mp and ar m rifles although unclear on the video tape because of obstruction from full view by agent s bodies they also may have had ak and sks rifles what type s of firearms did the batf agents have immediate access to at the scene of the original assault on the complex since there is no evidence to confirm anyone was inside the complex involuntarily why did the fbi treat it as a hostage situation along the same lines why did the fbi use psychological warfare techniques including sensory overload sleep deprivation and other disruptive techniques that would test the sanity of any normal person rather than using techniques aimed at placing the complex occupants into a calmer frame of mind reports indicate several of the children inside the complex were accompanied by their mothers since it is reasonable to expect these mothers would have their children taken away from them if they came out why did the fbi expect the mothers to just walk out and surrender themselves to the authorities agents at the scene claim to have seen members of the branch davidians setting fire to the complex branch davidian members who survived the inferno claim the fire was started when an armored vehicle punched through the wall and knocked over a lantern which was setting on a table video tape of the incident does show an armored vehicle punching a hole in the wall and the fire erupted almost immediately from the same general location was the source of the fire the same room where the armored vehicle penetrated fbi spokesmen are voicing the opinion that the david koresh and the members of the branch davidians committed mass suicide yet bodies are being discovered throughout the house and other areas within the building complex this seems to be counter to any known mass suicides through history what evidence does the fbi have that a mass suicide pact existed fbi director sessions stated that the massive fireball shown on the video tape was caused by the branch davidian s ammunition and or powder cache exploding yet the fireball seems to be more characteristic of the type created when compressed gas or other highly volatile fuel source explodes was any evidence found which would indicate the branch davidians had an ammunition and or powder cache which exploded to create this fireball if so and if david koresh and members of the branch davidians were engaged in the legal business of selling buying firearms was the amount determined to be excessively greater than one would expect for someone engaged in such a legal business it is rumored that one fbi agent was extremely upset about critical news media coverage and intentionally used an armored vehicle to crush a reporter s car which had been left at the compound is there any factual basis to this rumor and if so what charges will be brought against the fbi agent who performed the act fbi director sessions states that during the final assault on the complex over shots were fired at the vehicles on the video tape of the incident you can hear the drone of the armored vehicles engines yet there is no sound of the sharp reports that one would expect to hear if shots were fired also there are no indications of smoke and or muzzle flashes appearing from the windows buildings or other structures in the video surely these should be evident if the branch davidians had fired on the armored vehicles finally the video tape does not show any indication of paint splatter sparks or other characteristic spray of material which should be apparent if the branch davidians had fired upon the vehicles do any of the armored vehicles which were brought in to pump tear gas into the compound show evidence of fresh damage due to being hit by shots from high power rifles cs gas is considered to be a chemical warfare agent the united states has signed international treaties which prevent the use of cs gas in warfare if the united states could not morally use cs gas against saddam hussein and his troops why is it morally acceptable to use the same agent against citizens of our own land on april fbi spokesmen state that at least bodies discovered in the complex had bullet wounds to the head indicating they had been murdered or had committed suicide on april the county coroner claims he knows nothing about any bodies found with bullet wounds to the head were any of the victims bodies found within the burned out complex have bullet wounds to the head ron phillips crphilli hound dazixca ingr com senior customer engineer

4829###talk.politics.guns###re andy how do we stop people with a gun in article apr freenet carleton ca ac freenet carleton ca nikolaus maack writes come on a gun kills people rather people kill people with guns the sad truth is sometimes that is good or at least better than the alternative but let s ignore guns for defence and or crime and look at gun accidents ok there are about fatal firearm accidents per year and the number has been in decline since early this century most of these accidents involve rifles or shot guns not handguns but seriously a gun is designed to fire a bullet this is not so you can shoot cardboard cut outs down at the range in fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that the idea that my ruger mark ii bull barrel a semi auto caliber handgun was designed to kill or hurt people even for self defense would i m sure come as a surprise to its designer it certainly isn t why i have it it certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it and might even kill them but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to kill people this is not designed to act as a tool for home defence where you show someone that you have a gun and they go gee perhaps i should leave in fact that is what happens most of the time most self defensive uses of firearms don t involve firing any shots most criminals would prefer not to be shot and will go to some effort not to be including doing what you say when you point a gun at them if you were called on to design a tool that could be easily carried to immediately stop someone attacking you what would it be a handgun is about the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work the best no you see the gun was designed to fire that little bullet into a human body and hurt them not a tough concept to swallow for most certainly no one argues that handguns of the type we are discussing aren t deadly weapons however it simply isn t true to say that all of them were designed to kill people moreover what exactly is wrong with having deadly weapons there are times when it is perfectly legitimate to use deadly force e g in self defense i consider it not just my right but my duty to defend myself and my family and that includes having and knowing how to use the tools to do that the strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is as a last resort to protect themselves against tyranny in government t jefferson i think what jefferson said is still true and the trouble with having such an item is often the little bullet goes off into the wrong fleshy target not very often compared to other use or else uncle frank gets pissed and blows away his wife this isn t that common either at least when compared to other uses it is very rare that a non violent person will suddenly get pissed and kill someone gun or not in most cases the people who murder have long histories of violence if you have good reason to believe that these people wouldn t kill if they didn t have a gun feel free to present it having a thing specificly designed to kill means it is much easier to kill things right right but there are times when killing things is called for i hope i never have to shoot a person but i ve had to kill a number of animals from rodents to cows and when i do i don t want them to suffer any more than is necessary i prefer they die instantly but failing that i want them to drop so i can quickly finish them with the next shot and failing that i don t want them to go fast or far i try to choose the best weapon and ammunition i have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal i m after but it doesn t always work as i plan without belaboring the point people who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns particularly handguns haven t used them much for that purpose accidental deaths in deaths by auto deaths by fall deaths by drowning deaths by fire deaths by poison deaths by food deaths by

3978###sci.electronics###grounding power wiring was re a question about vac outlet wiring there has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding practices here a few points need to be clarified the equipment grounding conductor green green with a yellow stripe bare or the metal sheath or pipe of some wiring methods is used as a safety ground to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects it should never except for a few exceptions to be discussed later carry the normal operating current of a connected load some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation orange outlets are often used for this with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box and in many cases back to the service anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the national electric code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems the code requires the insulated grounding conductors green wires to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box and if required back all the way to the service entrance where it is bonded to the service ground water pipe or rod many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either the grounded conductor of a circuit often called the neutral which is referred to in the code as the identified conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey this conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point generally at the service entrance panel this connection is through the main bonding jumper in many household service panels the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel the grounded conductor neutral is generally a current carrying conductor in the case of a volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device since the grounded conductor neutral is only connected to the grounding conductor bare or green at the service entrance if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load under normal operating conditions if you should incorrectly connect the grounded neutral conductor to the grounding conductor at the load some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end if the load equipment has a metal case which is connected to the grounding conductor through the u ground plug the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential the difference under normal non short circuit conditions may be only a few tenths of a volt but it could also be a volt or two this normally does not present a shock hazard however if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe a radiator a metal air conditioning duct or such part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path if the contact is not solid you will get a significant arc a low voltage but possibly moderate current arc under the wrong conditions this arcing could start a fire it is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current could also flow through a wire of inadequate size causing it to overheat with the incorrect non single point grounding of the neutral if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor which increases the possibility for shock or fire also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment often causing malfunction i have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment the neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling this is done primarily for lightning protection so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly the bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer some of it flows through the grounding electrode water pipe etc this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks and it may also cause measurable ac magnetic fields due to the large loop between the hot conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground there are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy don t flame me on this i m just telling you where the field comes from not it s health effect as far as i m concerned the jury is still out on this note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel not at any sub distribution panels this is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral the sheath can be used in this application only as the grounding conductor if the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground with the possible problems listed above the code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers as well as feeds from one building to another in the cases of the range and dryer the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions instead of a seperate wire every time the code is revised these exceptions come up for review these exceptions were in fact the first required safety grounds in the days before u ground outlets and such the appliance manufacturers don t want to have to redesign their ranges and driers and the contractors don t want to have to run four wire cable with four fairly heavy expensive wires in place of three wire to the appliances no question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove but the neutral current is low for most burner settings since most current is in the volt hots except at some low settings the wires are large gauge and there are few reported cases of injury or damage so far the exceptions have survived in the case of feeds between buildings it s primarily for lightning protection people doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn t a legal grounding conductor obviously the bare wire in romex with ground is anywhere there is a green wire installed such as in a portable cord that is a good grounding conductor the sheath of bx clamped in bx connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor in the us bx has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath you can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends you don t have to bond it to anything it does its job by touching every turn of the bx sheath conduit or emt thinwall tubing is generally a legal grounding conductor but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel particularly for larger pipes greenfield looks like big bx but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it is not a legal grounding conductor as it doesn t have the aluminum band to bond it and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance you have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield wiremold is also not a legal grounding conductor as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact and the feed to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box i have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were hot with volts why do i get a shock every time i touch my computer and the radiator here in the office because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box you must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring conduit bx etc where you can bond the wire to the box with a screw bnding clip or whatever on another issue while you should ground the green wire lug on gcfi outlets when ever there is a place to ground them it is legal in the nec to use them without a

4787###talk.politics.guns###re my gun is like my american express card in article cmm thomasp surt ifi uio no thomas parsli thomasp ifi uio no writes gun clubs if you are a member you can borrow weapons suprised you are supposed to train with a for the months then you can start with anything bigger drivers licence forgot that usa is the land of cars getting one in scandinavia and northern europe is not easy average time is about hours of training and the cost is rather but we think this is acceptable because a car is not a toy and bad drivers tend to hurt others if you are really bad you won t get a lincence abuse by the goverment this seems to be one of the main problems any harder gun control would just be abused by the goverment either some of you are a little paranoid no offence or you should get a new goverment you do have elections unfortunately elections can and are bought promise the voters money and they will vote for you guns n criminals most weapons used by criminals today are stolen known criminals can not buy weapons that s one of the points of gun control same here convicted felons may not legally purchase firearms and because gun control are strict in whole scandinavia and most of europe we dont have any problem with smuggled guns that you know of while i lived in the dbr a gang robbed a joint us army bundewehr armoury and got several hundred m s ammunition handguns and some explosives when i left two years later there were no clues mixing weapons and things that can be use as one what i meant was that cars can kill but they are not guns someone said that if we ban guns we d have to ban cars to because they kill to i don t think we should argue on this one the issue i hope i think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem guns are not a problem but the way they are used is and what are they for who uses them is the problem crime in the u s is no big deal if you are the criminal how about years for murder credit for time served in jail waiting for trial and you are out in months worst case if we would put criminals especially violent ones in the slam for true sentences crime would drop instead we reward them for being good and let them out early very early i think this discusion is interesting when you think of ex jugoslavia they should all have weapons it s their rigth to have them and if they use them to kill other innocent people the problem is humans not guns serbs croats and muslims have been killing each other almost since before the invention of guns old women are throwing stones at un trucks this is a hatred that goes beyond reason if of all murders was done with axes would you impose some regulations on them or just say that they are ment to be used at trees and that the axe is not a problem it s the axer an example don t flame me just because not exactly are killed by guns yes the problem is the user question back since you are one of the rational ones if all gun crime were to stop would you support dropping all gun controls think about the situation in los angeles where people are buying guns to protect themselves is this a good situation is it the rigth way to deal with the problem they did not believe from experience that the police including national guard could would protect them unless you want to argue that a human being does not have a right to protect him herself they did the right thing what would you suggest as a defense against a mob throwing bottles and rocks and also likely armed with stolen firearms if everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals and their neighbor who have guns what do you think will happen i mean if everybody had a gun in usa criminals would move to scandinavia the average criminal would look for a less hazardous job and the rest would likely be buried at county expense don t flame the englishmen because of northern irland they have gun control that works in england and fonds from usa are one of the reasons why ira can bomb innocents something about throwing stones in glass houses personally i criticize the fools who send money to the ira to make ireland free of course this is the last thing the ira wants because they lose power if england pulls out but that s for another group don t flame them because of what to three children did either the u s has roughly times the major sporting events as the u k how many riots did we have at sporting events last year off the playing field hooligan is a word never used when reffering to sports fans here i guess that s where the different cultures thing comes in can an jugoslav have an oppinion on guns or even peace yes yes the question is is the problem one of too many guns mostly from the army or not enough nonserbians can not defend themselves my numbers about crime rates after restrictions on shot guns are from the police and the statistisk sentralbyraa understood that one sorenson last word responsible gun owners are not a problem but they
