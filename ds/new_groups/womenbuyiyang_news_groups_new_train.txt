caltech edu aaron ray clements writes the second amendment is a guarantee of the right to bear arms clearly and unequivocally without infringement unfortunately the second amendment is not as clear as you state if last part of it is taken along it follows what you have said the problem i have is with the first part of the single sentence which makes up the amendment the second amendment is a well regulated militia being necessary to the security militia of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear state arms shall not be infringed arms you didn t even get the capitalization correct try reading usca on the constitution or get any other correct version of the constitution this mention of a well regulated militia is what confuses me according to the federalist paper s a well regulated militia has a well defined structure and follows nationally uniform regulations perhaps you should actually read the federalist papers james madison federalist paper besides the advantage of being armed which the americans possess over the people of almost every other nation the existence of subordinate governments to which the people are attached and by which the militia officers are appointed forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of europe which are carried as far as the public resources will bear the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms james madison i annals of congress june the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed a well regulated militia composed of the body of the people trained to arms is the best and most natural defense of a free country alexander hamilton federalist paper on the organization of the militia little more can reasonably be aimed at with respect to the people at large than to have them properly armed and equipped and in order to see that this be not neglected it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year alexander hamilton federalist paper speaking of standing armies if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens little if at all inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow citizens but surely hamilton and madison didn t mean the people when they said people right that s why the amendment refers to the right of the militia your average year old male does not fall into the definition you re right the militia consists of all able bodied males and probably females under current interpretation therefore most members of the militia the one the every gun advocate refers to are not members of a well organized militia and therefore are not directly the amendment does nor refer to well organized it says well regulated i have some targets you may examine if you wish to check how well regulated i am mentioned in the amendment if this amendment wanted to allow every member of the militia to keep and bear arms why did it specificly mention a well organized militia in the same sentence as the right to keep and bear arms correct that s why the right is reserved to the people and that was to insure the people could form a well regulated militia not a well organized militia it could be argued that the first part of the sentence is separate from the last part if so why was it include in the same atomic unit of written what do atomic units have to do with this argument any moron can set h bar c instead of a separate sentence oh i see what your question is why don t you read the federalist papers james madison federalist paper regarding the general welfare clause nothing is more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars but what does madison know about the grammatical style of the nd he only wrote it the amendment also implies that the right to arms has to due with the security of a free state the federalist paper s mention of a well regulated militia gives many examples of how this militia protects the security of a free state all these examples are actions of a very organized force not some john q public with a gun that s obviously because you ve never actually read the federalist papers all that the second amendment clearly states to me is that the people s right to form well regulated militias shall not be infringed that is people have the right to join a well organized militia this well organized militia will of course provide training in how to use arms and in basic military tactics these training members of the militia can keep and bear the arms can t read huh show me where the document says well organized militia lastly reading through the federalist paper s on well organized militia it is very clear that many of the reasons for these militias one reason stated is the protection from a standing army these days the standing army could easily defeat a group consisting of every year old male and female not in the armied forces that is exactly why every person should be allowed to own any weapon currently in use in the armed forces another reason stated for well organized militias is to reduced the need for a standing army well the us armied forces have been a standing army for more than half the history of the us but the major reason is to protect against that very same army it seems to me the whole reason for the second amendment to give the people protection from the us government by guaranteeing that the people can over through the government if necessary is a little bit of an anachronism is this day and age maybe its time to re think how this should be done and amend the constitution appropriately abraham lincoln first inaugural address march this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it rep elbridge gerry of massachusetts spoken during floor debate over the second amendment i annals of congress at august what sir is the use of a militia it is to prevent the establishment of a standing army the bane of liberty whenever governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of the people they always

the fourth amendment by unreasonably search ing and seizing private property it has ignored the fifth amendment by taking private property without just compensation and by entrapping honest citizens

he also asserted that the bureau has recently made great strides toward achieving these priorities no documen tation was offered for either of these assertions in hearings before batf s appropriations

possession and use of firearms especially in the area of drug related crimes it enforces the armed career criminal act which calls for mandatory minimum sentences for repeat felons using firearms to carry out an illegal activity the bureau has made itself a key component in preventing gang related violence also both by educating at risk youth to the dangers of gang membership as well a s by depriving known gangs from access to weapons the waco texas case involved the execution of search warrants by atf on the branch davidians for illegal firearms and explosives possession automatics semi automatics and machine guns in addition to bombs and other explosives in virtually every gun case atf is asked to trace weapons through its national firearms tracing center where they keep all dealer and federal firearms license information atf is the federal governments firearms expert and routinely works with state and local police to execute warrants atf working with state and local law enforcement in texas and the u s attorneys office felt it was necessary to execute these warrants in order to legally establish that a crime had been committed and conclude a long and thorough investigation of illegal gun and explosives held by members of the branch davidians in addition atf carefully selected a sunday morning knowing from their source inside that the men would be separated from the women and children and not in the area where it was known that the illegal weapons were stored as you may be aware by now vernon howell a k a david koresh spiritual leader of the branch davidians was tipped of the impending execution of the search warrants unfortunately atf lost the element of surprise and the cult was able to arm themselves and prepare for atfs entry into the compound once a hostage situation presented itself the atf asked the fbi to become involved since the fbi is skilled in hostage negotiations in addition and military tanks were brought in due to the serious nature of the situation and firepower of the branch davidians based on what i have learned about atf s role in the branch davidian raid i believe the agency acted responsibly i am however deeply saddened by the loss of lives of the law enforcement agents who attempted to enter the compound and the civilian members of the cult i fully expect the department of treasury to conduct a thorough evaluation with representatives from law enforcement outside the department to be headed by the assistant secretary for enforcement in addition atf will conduct its own review of the waco operation i look forward to reviewing the findings of the evaluators and hope this situation in waco will be brought to a quick and peaceful conclusion sincerely dennis deconcini chairman subcommittee

2028###comp.graphics###virtual reality for x on the cheap hi everyone i thought that some people may be interested in my vr software on these groups announcing the release of multiverse multiverse is a multi user non immersive x windows based virtual reality system primarily focused on entertainment research features client server based model using berkeley sockets no limit to the number of users apart from performance generic clients customizable servers hierachical objects allowing attachment of cameras and light sources multiple light sources ambient point and spot objects can have extension code to handle unique functionality easily attached functionality client the client is built around a fast render loop basically it changes things when told to by the server and then renders an image from the user s viewpoint it also provides the server with information about the user s actions which can then be communicated to other clients and therefore to other users the client is designed to be generic in other words you don t need to develop a new client when you want to enter a new world this means that resources can be spent on enhancing the client software rather than adapting it the adaptations as will be explained in a moment occur in the servers this release of the client software supports the following functionality o hierarchical objects with associated addressing o multiple light sources and types ambient point and spot o user interface panels o colour polygonal rendering with phong shading optional wireframe for faster frame rates o mouse and keyboard input some people may be disappointed that this software doesn t support the powerglove as an input device this is not because it can t but because i don t have one this will however be one of the first enhancements server s this is where customization can take place the following basic support is provided in this release for potential world server developers o transparent client management o client message handling this may not sound like much but it takes away the headache of accepting and terminating clients and receiving messages from them the application writer can work with the assumption that things are happening locally things get more interesting in the object extension functionality this is what is provided to allow you to animate your objects o server selectable extension installation what this means is that you can decide which objects have extended functionality in your world basically you call the extension initialisers you want o event handler registration when you develop extensions for an object you basically write callback functions for the events that you want the object to respond to current events supported init move change collide terminate o collision detection registration if you want your object to respond to collision events just provide some basic information to the collision detection management software your callback will be activated when a collision occurs this software is kept separate from the worldserver applications because the application developer wants to build a library of extended objects from which to choose the following is all you need to make a world server application o provide an initworld function this is where you choose what object extensions will be supported plus any initialization you want to do o provide a positionobject function this is where you determine where to place a new client o provide an installworldobjects function this is where you load the world wld file for a new client o provide a getworldtype function this is where you tell a new client what persona they should have o provide an animateworld function this is where you can go wild at a minimum you should let the objects move by calling a move function and let the server sleep for a bit to avoid outrunning the clients that s all there is to it and to prove it here are the line counts for the three world servers i ve provided generic lines dactyl lines more complicated collision detection due to the stairs will probably be improved with future versions dogfight lines location this software is located at the following site ftp u washington edu directory pub virtual worlds file multiverse tar z futures client o texture mapping o more realistic rendering i e z buffering or similar gouraud shading o hmd support o etc etc server o physical modelling gravity friction etc o enhanced object management interaction o etc etc both o improved comms i hope this provides people with a good understanding of the multiverse software unfortunately it comes with practically zero documentation and i m not sure whether that will ever be able to be rectified i hope people enjoy this software and that it is useful in our explorations of the virtual universe i ve certainly found fascinating developing it and i would love to add support for the powerglove and an hmd finally one major disclaimer this is totally amateur code by that i mean there is no support for this code other than what i out the kindness of my heart or you out of pure desperation provide i cannot be held responsible for anything good or bad that may happen through the use of this code use it at your own risk disclaimer over of course if you love it i would like to here from you and anyone with positive contributions

to use them or even threaten anyone with them to self defense incidents a year doesn t count with you what do they do right or are they just lucky maybe they re just unlucky if a rapist pulls a woman into an alley in boston chances are almost certain that she won t be counted as one of those self defenders because our local constabulary didn t consider it important that she be allowed to arm herself even though the shotgun she owns at home makes her show up in the gun owner column in either case this means the average threat level in this country is rather low ironic words for somebody who lives in florida the average threat level in florida has been reduced by a liberal ccw policy it s well known that your local thugs like to target tourists precisely because they are less likely to be carrying than your natives come on up to boston or nyc or washington dc and see how much diddlysquat the average threat level in the country means to a resident there i think you have weapons on the brain i never said that these alternative means of self protection involved any hardware why are good neighborhoods good it isn t because every person is armed to the teeth it is because of attitude and cooperation in the good neighborhoods the residents make themselves aware of their neighbors and notice when strangers are lurking around good neighborhoods form groups like crime watch to increase this effect and the relative effectiveness of the police when hostiles are arrested the good neighbors step up and say that s the one officer he was robbing mr jones house sometimes this works sometimes it just lands your good neighbors on the dance card for the next wave of drive bys someone here once told a story about la gangs moving into phoenix i ve misplaced the original text but the story started with one resident calling the cops on a gang member sure enough a few nights later there was a drive by performed at the resident s house except that this time unlike in la the entire street came out and returned fire putting an end to the car s occupants the gang packed up and left of course in la or in a place like florida after the hurricane your first problem is to find an officer to step up to and tell anything in short the alternative to firepower is gangs or at least a benificent manifestation of that social cooperative replace lead with flesh the flesh makes a better conversationalist too and you can invite it over for a block party look nobody is arguing this i have a fire extinguisher at home that doesn t mean i can be careless about tossing my burnt matches on the carpet i live carefully monitor the woodstove get my flue cleaned twice a year and test my smoke alarms annually but if despite all this a fire does start it s too late for any of these things except the extinguisher but legality and legitimacy also matter if a government s charter makes a rule which the government then violates it is violated the basis for its existance enforcement of its will becomes a matter solely of force of arms oliver north the man is positively worshiped in many all american conservative quarters he and big ron set up a secret government and did all sorts of severely illegal deeds the kind of stuff you and i would be doing twenty to life for yet he walks free this bs happens all the time in fact it happens so much that no one really cares anymore legitimacy is a non issue legality is a non issue so long as we get t bones and our mtv who gives a rats ass you seem to be agreeing with your opponent you can t trust your government to protect you

article on paxton quigley armed force wsj cites the world s most notorious statistic regarding guns in the home a pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in king county washington found that a gun in the home was times more likely to be used to kill its owner spouse a friend or child than to kill an intruder the times stat is everywhere these days it has grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth it was inflated by one pugilistic talk show pundit to given the shock value of the finding the conclusion of the new england journal of medicine nejm study is remarkably understated the advisability of keeping firearms in the home for protection must be questioned responsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of bringing a firearm into their home but what we need to know is this what exactly are the risks and benefits the nejm testimony is neither the whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the risks further as with motor vehicles we want to know what control do we have over the risks and benefits and as with the risks of cancer or heart disease or auto accidents how can we minimize the risks like raw highway death tolls the nejm stat is not very helpful here the nejm finding purports to inform us but it is framed to warn us off it is widely promulgated in the media as a scare stat a misleading half truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice and terrify the frightful statistic screams for itself the risks far outweigh the benefits yes what fool would run these risks if your car were times more likely to kill you a loved one a dear friend or an innocent child than to get you to your destination should you not take the bus uncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company of lies and damned lies surely we can do better where lives are at stake let s take a closer look at this risky business the times stat of the nejm study is the product of dividing the number of home intruders aggressors justifiably killed in self defense the divisor into the number of family members or acquaintances killed by a gun in the home the dividend the divisor of this risk equation is in the study s five year sample there were intruders and other cases of self defense the dividend is in the study there were accidental deaths criminal homicides and suicides divided by yields there were a total of gun related deaths in king county between and so the study leaves deaths outside of homes unaccounted the nejm s notorious times statistic is seriously misleading on six counts the dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media the or acquaintances of the study who include your friendly drug dealers and neighborhood gang members is equated to friends the implication is that the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members dear friends and innocent children deaths may all be equally tragic but the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are relevant to the risk these crucial risk factors are masked by the calculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless waltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors this is criminological hogwash the study itself does not distinguish households or environs populated by people with violent criminal or substance abuse histories where the risk of death is very high versus households inhabited by more civil folk for example people who avoid high risk activities like drug dealing gang banging and wife beating where the risk is very low indeed in actuality negligent adults allow fatal but avoidable accidents and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with histories of violence or abuse people who are identifiably and certifiably at high risk for misadventure to ignore these obvious risk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as ignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths by tautology neither gun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or vehicles but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver crucially affect the risk one misleading implication of the way the nejm stat is framed is that the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill than to protect and this obscures indeed disregards the role of personal responsibility the typical quotation of this study unlike larson s attributes fatal agency to the gun a gun in the home is times as likely to kill the center to prevent handgun violence a major promulgator of the nejm statistic uses this particular formulation we can dispense with the silly debate about whether it s people or guns that accomplish the killing again by tautology gun deaths would not occur without the guns the question begged is how many deaths would occur anyway without the guns in any case people are the death dealing agents the guns are their lethal instruments the moral core of the personal risk factors in gun deaths are personal responsibility and choice due care and responsibility obviate gun accidents human choice mediates homicide and suicide by gun or otherwise the choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to nejm s high risk pool the gun does not create this risk by itself people have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their homes for example graduates of paxton quigley s personal protection course do not run the touted times risk any more than skilled and sober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death as do reckless or drunk drivers undiscriminating actuarials disregard and obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice just as they disregard and obscure the role of socio economic criminological and other risk relevant factors in firearm related death this is why we resent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose norms disregard our individualities fortunately nothing can consign us to the nejm risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in the matter suicide accounts for of the deaths by gun in the home in the nejm study as against the total deaths by gun in king county including those outside the home in house suicides are of the total death toll which is closer to the roughly proportion found by other studies suicide is a social problem of a very different order from homicide or accidents the implication of the nejm study is that these suicides might not occur without readily available guns it is true that attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed it is not obviously true that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these suicides this is widely assumed or alleged but the preponderance of research on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise that this is wishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases see bruce l danto et al the human side of homicide columbia university press charles rich et al guns and suicide american journal of psychiatry march if suicides were removed from the dividend of the nejm study s risk equation the times stat would deflate to six the inclusion of suicides in the nejm risk equation like the causes durability or interdiction of suicidal intent itself is a profoundly debatable matter quotations of the nejm study totally disregard this issue citations of the nejm study also mislead regarding the estimable rate of justifiable and excusable homicide most measures like the nejm homicide rate are based on the immediate disposition of cases but many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled self defense in the literature on battered women immediate case dispositions are notorious for under representing the rate of justifiable or excusable homicide time s january cover story on women fighting back reported one study s finding that of women who appeal have their murder convictions thrown out time s july cover story on a week of gun deaths reported of the domestic cases as shootings by abuse victims but only of the homicides were reported as self defense in a may update time reported that of the homicides had eventually been ruled self defense in time s sample the originally reported rate of self defense was in error by a factor of four the possibility of such error is not acknowledged by promulgators of the nejm statistic while both the dividend and the product of the nejm risk equation are arguably inflated the divisor is unconscionably misleading the divisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed not aggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even shot at the utility of armed self defense is the other side of the coin from the harms done with guns in homes what kind of moral idiocy is it to measure this utility only in terms of killings do we measure the utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed as opposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled apprehended or deterred should we not celebrate let alone count those cases where no human life is lost as successful armed defenses the question posed to media that cite the nejm scare stat is this why neglect the compendious research on successful armed defense notably by criminologist gary kleck point blank guns and violence in america aldine de gruyter kleck s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are based on victimization surveys as well as other studies the rate is high about one million a year and the risk is good gun defenders fare better than anyone either those who resort to other forms of resistance or those who do not resist dividing one million gun defenses a year by annual gun deaths from self defense homicides suicides and accidents yields thus we can construct a much more favorable statistic than the nejm scare stat a gun is times more likely to be used to defend against assault or other crime than to kill anybody of course kleck s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation what is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control we should indeed question the basis and method of kleck s high estimation of defensive firearm use as i have questioned the nejm statistic clearly the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by uncritical citation of statistics one thing troubles me still we can hardly escape the unquestioned nejm scare stat in our media but we hardly ever find kleck s good work mentioned even critically larry cipriani l v cipriani att com

deleted lines emacs continually gave me the message garbage collecting done think it s trying to tell me something viking iastate edu dan sorenson writes and thank you it s a great change from the same tired old debates you lurkers can join in at any time you know ahhh talk politics guns the kindler gentler newsgroup who would have thought no not exactly the only reason for this sort of restriction is the possible endangerment of others a poorly maintained rifle is dangerous but only to the user since it doesn t endanger others there is no justification for such restrictions i remind you of shrapnel i consider a reasonable space limitation but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to those nearby say in the next lane at the range my point was at what distance or level of threat we draw the line is it the endangerment of others so we do a restriction or the possibility of being shot hence we draw a mile restriction or a nuke and draw a mile restriction to me they al suffer from the fundamental flaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user perhaps sen metzenbaum declaring the barrett light fifty an assault rifle has made this more apparent to me since the barrett has only range and acurracy going for it they have determined that their lives are worth the effort to protect their homes and families using nuclear weapons close to home will not accomplish this i disagree on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much more easily than my family once i have died i assume that word would get to the citizens that such an attack was planned if this is not the case the tactical and strategic implications change quite a bit personally my home is worth say twenty martians intent on taking over the world my family all of them the balancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk there is however another problem in any case of civil war the strength of the militias fighting on each side should reflect the popular will if the public is split versus then the minorities militias should be at a disadvantage such a need for popular support would hopefully prevent insurrections unless the people really were behind the rebels but heavy weapons owned by a small fraction of the militia could distort this what if the minority included all the tank and artillery owners that seems to be the case already given that heavy weapons aren t commonly owned by the citizenry with such low numbers obviously due to cost i don t think the superior weapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically superior foe furthermore it is even more doubtful their training includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness i think it is vital to avoid such a situation where a small minority would have a reasonable chance of gaining political power through violence to prevent this it may be necessary to give control of heavy weapons e g those which only a small number of individuals would own and whose firepower would grossly distort the relation between popular support and military strength to someone other that individual militiamen this is certainly not a good thing but i think it is the lesser of two evils whoever controls these weapons must be a democratic body responsive to the will of the people i had envisioned that the armorer perhaps the officers of a select group and the like would exercise control over the heavier more complex weapons but if joe bob owns an old sherman tank i certainly wouldn t ask him to give it up follow orders from the officers yes since the expense of a tank is so large though chances are it would be jointly purchased and should therefore be jointly maintained and operated here i think we have to be carefull about which state we are talking about certainly one role of the militia is to overthrow a repressive government and it would be completely destructive to that end for that same government to control the militia s arms but the united states have several levels of government each able to act independently but not all likely targets of rebelion as such rebelions against state and local governments are very unlikely i think therefore that the state or possibly local governments could safely be allowed to keep the select militia s heavy weapons the risk of abuse while still something to consider is far less than the similar risk were the federal government in control this i ll agree with to a point the state having control over the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state to have them centrally located keep them spread out such that the ability of the state to lock them up isn t so easy otherwise i would have to assume that state control would rest on the authority of the governor and militia officers that is eaxctly why i think they should be removed the select militia should privide the militia s heavy weapons and highly trained specialists for the reasons i have outlines above i think these heavy weapons tanks artillery aircraft etc are better off being kept by local governments than by a small number of individuals however local governments shouldn t be able to use the select militia without the support to the people ideally the general militia under the direct control of the people and the select militia under the direction of democratic local governments would opperate together but even in the worst case the general militia should be able to functional without the select militia similarly the select militia should be incapable of action without the aid of the general militia i m having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons fairly few in numbers could not be easily wielded by a few people with government support just as you argued above that the weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control so one side doesn t have all of them i can t see where this situation is alleviated in having the select militia holding all the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry i think a better mix is called for but i would argue that the federal army should rely upon the select militia and the unorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units consider then the effect of removing the national guard s infantry and placing the guard under the control of local governments the government controled select militia could not fight effectively without infantry support provided by the general militia an inherently infantry organization on the other hand the general militia could function although at a disadvantage without the backing of local governments and the select militia we have to assume that there would be those who would side with the government controlled forces and if they ve all the equipment an infantry force x the size would be in trouble i d like to see that heavy stuff say tanks offset by the local troups having a few s and anti tank weapons in their armory these would be much more useful to infantry than the tank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in i suppose i m quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment but a mechanized infantry unit is what builds dikes in times of flood sets up disaster relief cities and the like i would much rather see these things handled by the local general militias so would i but the resources often aren t available to outfit local units well enough thus we will certainly have to call in others and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster than anything else perhaps the national guard isn t as close to my conception of the select militia as i thought i was considering them to be the heavy weapons armor arm of the militia not the infantry arm of the regular army perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different i think main battle tanks self propelled artillery and mm and up field pieces are heavy stuff m troop carriers ton trucks humvee s old m tanks howitzers are more the stuff of a mechanized infantry actually this is what the guard units in iowa are currently fielding in some units perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy equipment under state control with little but numbers and light stuff to act as a deterrent allowing main battle tanks to the states should be balanced with anti tank capability in the local ranks similarly local units would need to band together quickly hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry finally the militia is more than just fighting equipment is needed for other responses the federal army i m convinced should have a very minumum of infantry relying on the state and local militias for these functions dan sorenson dod z dan exnet

82###comp.graphics###scientific visualization of chemical systems molecules has evolved from an esoteric academic subject into a international industry computer graphics has played a decisive role in this transformation by allowing chemists to build visualize and interact with complex geometrical objects while computer scientists are conversant in the language of their own discipline they are often unfamiliar with the terminology simulation techniques and practical needs of research chemists similarly chemists are often unfamiliar with the latest paradigms and technological advances in graphical computing this interdisciplinary course is intended to bridge the gap between computer science and chemistry and to equip chemistry researchers who wish to be more than just casual users of prepackaged graphics software although this is not intended to be a course in computational chemistry or drug design data sets from chemical research problems will be used in lab and students will be encouraged to bring data sets of their own lab exercises and projects will be carried out using data flow programming ibm visualization data explorer software and students will have access to cornell theory center computing resources including video recording equipment audience researchers and students in the chemical and biological sciences interested in integrating state of the art computer

4436###talk.politics.guns###re my gun is like my american express card in article cmm thomasp surt ifi uio no thomas parsli thomasp ifi uio no writes abuse by the goverment this seems to be one of the main problems any harder gun control would just be abused by the goverment either some of you are a little paranoid no offence mr parsli i have to take exception at this there are verifiable previous examples of levels of u s governments abusing gun control restrictions i don t think it is paranoid to worry that what has been abused in the recent past might be abused in thye future after so many times of getting burned any sane person will stop putting his hand on the stove or you should get a new goverment you do have elections i d love to but as long as the politicians grab power to sell pork back to their constituents there s not a lot i can do it s silly to suggest that if there s anything we can t trust the government to do and therefore the government should be allowed to do it then we should change governments down that road lies total government power i ve never been a fan of totalitarianism guns n criminals most weapons used by criminals today are stolen this is very likely known criminals can not buy weapons that s one of the points of gun control and because gun control are strict in whole scandinavia and most of europe we dont have any problem with smuggled guns the north american continent is not europe no matter how many people would like it to be drugs are very illegal and they re here for years canada has crowed about its gun control if it is necessary to control guns over the whole continent then canada should have always had comparable rates to the u s yet they still don t unless you can tell me why the canadian border is so much more magical than the mexican border which is shorter and far more heavily patrolled then i really can t accept that argument mixing weapons and things that can be use as one what i meant was that cars can kill but they are not guns no there are approximately deaths due to guns in the u s two thirds of which are suicides unfortunately i don t have suicide rates for norway however this makes the per gun death rate about half the per car death rate the issue i hope i think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem guns are not a problem but the way they are used is and what are they for i think this discusion is interesting when you think of ex jugoslavia they should all have weapons it s their rigth to have them and if they use them to kill other innocent people the problem is humans not guns the problem s been humans since before we had stone axes the fct of the matter is simply this if nobody ever assaulted anybody whether there is a weapon of any sort around would be totally irrelevent yet weapons are built i d suggest then that the murderous impulse in humanity pre dates weapons anyway the bosnians et al have been making an excellent attempt to kill each other for half a thousand years taking away their guns even if we could would neither halt the killing nor reduce the brutality if of all murders was done with axes would you impose some regulations on them or just say that they are ment to be used at trees and that the axe is not a problem it s the axer an example don t flame me just because not exactly are killed by guns in the u s approximately of murders are commited with firearms with handguns with non handguns the reason i say that guns per se are not the problem is that our non gun rate exceeds most of europe s countries entire violent crime rate i don t really think we ve got more knives or fists in any case i think examples of gun control applied to the u s have been abkect failures just like drug prohibition and other forms of prohibition until you deal with why people are doing what they are doing you won t solve your problem and if the problem is violent crime you shouldn t concentrate on the tools instead the vast majority of guns is never ever misused on the order of over the entire lifetime of the gun this says to me that you can t make the argument that the gun itself causes the misuse think about the situation in los angeles where people are buying guns to protect themselves is this a good situation the situation is not good in that people fear for their lives but recall the scenes of the store owners during the last riots protecting their shops with guns would it have been better they too lost their livelihoods is it the rigth way to deal with the problem the problem of poverty and rage in los angeles no it isn t however if that problem becomes a violent action then yes it can be appropriate whether or not some person has been hurt by their condition won t make me less dead if they burn down my house with me in it you have to examine which problem you re referring to if you re discussing someone violently assaulting you then it is a perfectly legitimate response to make them stop hopefully simply letting them know you re prepared to shoot them would be enough as it was with the above mentioned store owners if everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals and their neighbor who have guns what do you think will happen i mean if everybody had a gun in usa of households have some form of firearm usually a long gun that accounts for a level of access for at least million americans firearm ownership is most likely among educated well off whites the group least likely to be involved in violent crime you may take that for what it s worth david veal univ of tenn div of cont education info

4295###talk.politics.guns###vancouver seattle study critiques open letter by dr paul h blackman research coordinator for nra ila nra official journal dear sir by now we are used to the new england journal of medicine s publication of small scale studies related to firearms from which conclusions are drawn which are quantum leaps from the data followed by announcements of momentus scientific findings these are regularly released to the press without the caveats which riddle the conclusory paragraphs and often accompanied by an editorial calling attention to the findings generally while they at least present a few interesting data however meaningless the studies misinterpret statistics and ignore or belittle serious studies by criminologists the latest effort handgun regulations crime assaults and homicide a tale of two cities by j h sloan et al with the accompanying editorial firearms injuries a call for science by two employees of the centers for disease control november however is an insult to the intelligence of any serious scholar in any field and have so few data and so many flaws that i feel compelled to write at some length to call attention to various major and minor failings in no particular order the authors misleadingly cite wright et al ref to support the statement that some have argued that restricting access to handguns could substantially reduce our annual rate of homicide wright et al in fact studied and rejected that contention the authors pretended that vancouver and seattle are very similar cities with similar economic circumstances histories demographic characteristics and the like in fact the cities are very different with very different demographic characteristics which appear to explain completely the higher homicide rate in seattle both cities are over three forths non hispanic white and the non hispanic white homicide rates are reported to be the same in seattle and vancouver it is the different back grounds problems circumstances and behaviors of the various ethnic minorities which explain the difference in homicide the authors pretend they are evaluating canada s gun law compared to washington state s but they do not examine at all the situation in vancouver prior to the gun law taking effect in as it happens in the three years prior to that vancouver averaged homicides per year one eighth involving handguns ref and in the seven years of the nejm article there were homicides per year one eigth involving handguns surely even the medical profession recognizes that one must look to see the prior situation was before concluding that a change made a difference would a physician conclude that a patient was benefiting from eating oat bran muffin each day for seven years because his cholesterol level was without at least seeing if it was before he started the regimen the authors pick two medium sized cities to evaluate a national gun law nothing can be learned from such a tiny and arbitrarily selected sample seattle appears to have been selected because it was convienient for the authors rather than for any scientific reason would physicians call something a scientific study which involved one experimental subject and one dissimilar control had different arbitrarily selected cities been chosen opposite scientific conclusions would follow vancouver s homicide rate exceeds that of such wild west cities in texas as el paso corpus christi austen and in colorado colorado springs ref the authors fail to clearly demonstrate that firearms or handguns are far more commonly owned in seattle than in vancouver they use two surrogate approaches in pretending to study the availability of firearms handguns the first is an apples and oranges effort to compare the number of carry permits in seattle to the number of registered handguns in vancouver but the number clearly understates the number of handguns in seattle and counts primarily protective handgun owners the second however tells nothing about the number of handguns in vancouver and counts non protective handguns for the most part where is it difficult to obtain handguns legally for protection registration figures are meaningless there are registered handguns in new york city new york daily news sept comparing the two that method suggests about handguns per population in new york city compared to in vancouver meaning vancouver has a greater prevalence of weapons than new york city the second method of measuring gun density is cook s gun prevalence index a previously validated measure of intercity differences but the validation was by cook of his own theory ref normally second opinions are sought from a different doctor more significantly the cook index is based on the average of the percentage of firearms involvement in suicide and homicide so the authors are basically taking a measure of misuse unsurprisingly gun misuse in homicide in seattle in vancouver is related to gun misuse in homicide plus suicide divided by two in seattle in vancouver the authors are not measuring the relative avail ability of firearms or of handguns in seattle and vancouver the authors misstate the laws of both washington and canada they neglect to mention the significant fact that washington has a waiting period and background check prior to the purchase of a handgun and that provisions exist in canadian law for owning and carrying handguns for personal protection the authors also make it appear that it is more difficult to get a handgun legally in canada than is actually the case the authors ignore all other factors which might explain the differences in crime rate beyond some vague mention of the penalities provided by law and the roughest of estimates of clearence for one particular offense homicide involving a firearm there is no measure of the differences in the number of law enforcement officers their aggressiveness in making arrests for gun law violations in the two jurisdictions arrest rates for other offenses conviction rates actual sentences imposed for gun related crimes violent crimes without guns or gun law violations or incarceration rates whereas social scientists would attempt to measure and hold for such differences the authors of the nejm tale of two cities fail even to mention most factors related to crime control the authors dismiss claims that handguns are an effective means for protection unless the criminal is killed such is not the case criminologists ref have found that almost americans annually use handguns for protection from criminals and that using a gun for protection reduces the liklihood that a crime rape robbery assault will be completed by the criminal and reduces the likelihood of injury to the victim it is interesting nonetheless that the authors reported the same number four of civilian justifiable homicides without firearms in each city but that less restrictive seattle accounted for of the reported civilian justifiable homicides involving firearms the centers for disease control which funded the study editorially praised the paper ref saying it applied scientific methods to examine a focus of contention betweeb advocates of stricter regulation of firearms particularly handguns there is nothing in the paper which could possibly be mistaken for scientific methods by a sociologists or criminologists the vancouver seattle study is the equivolent of testing an experimental drug to control hypertension by finding two ordinary looking middle class white males one aged and the other and without first taking their vital signs administering the experimental drug to the year old while giving the year old a placebo then taking their blood pressure and on finding the younger man had a lower blood pressure announcing in a special article a new medical breakthrough it would be nice to think that such a study would neither be funded by the cdc or printed by the nejm since the longstanding anti gun biases of the nejm and the cdc make them willing to present shoddy research as scientific breakthroughs in special articles and editorials relating to firearms we are obligated to correct the record by notifying the news media and those with congressional and executive oversight over the activities of the centers for disease control about the distortions contained in handgun regulations crime assaults and homicides a tale of two cities and firearm injuries a call for science clearly all scientific standards go by the wayside whenever the cdc and the new england journal of medicine seize an opportunity to attack firearms ownership in america references wright jd et al weapons crime and violence in america a literature review and research agenda washington d c department

a call for science nejm guns and sputter by james d wright from july issue of reason free minds free markets someone once wrote statistics are like a bikini what they real is suggestive but what they conceal is vital the problem is demonstrated by the most recent entry in a long line of scientific research purporting to show a causal link between gun availability and homicide funded by the federal government and published last year in the new england journal of medicine the study compared homicide rates in seattle and vancouver and suggested that a handgun ban may reduce the rate of homicide in a community the nine medical doctors who published handgun regulations crime assaults and homicide essentially reasoned in three steps despite many historical social and demographic similarities vancouver has a markedly lower homicide rate because its stricter gun regulations make guns less available the second step in their reasoning seems indisputable the overall homicide rate in seattle for the period was per popuation compared with in vancouver homicide is definitely more common in seattle the question then becomes why the authors present a believable although not entirely accurate case to support the notion as claimed in the third step of their reasoning that vancouver s handgun regulations are much more stringent but their evidence on the difference in gun availabilty is indirect and unpersuasive indeed they acknowledge that direct evidence on the point does not exist they offer two fragments of inferential data in support of the claim that guns are more available in seattle but for all anybody knows as a matter of empirical fact the opposite could be true we are therefore being asked at the conclusion of the study to believe that a difference in gun availability explains the difference in homicide rates when a difference in gun availability has not itself been established indeed the situation is even more troublesome the first of the two indirect bits of evidence is a difference between the number of concealed weapons permits issued in seattle and the number of restricted weapons permits issued in vancouver differences between the two cities in the permit regulations render these two numbers strictly noncomparable the second bit of evidence is cook s gun prevalence index which stands at percent for seattle but only percent for vancouver cook s index however does not measure the relative prevalence of gun ownership in various cities it measures gun misuse it is an average of the percentage of homicides and suicides involving firearms in the present case the index shows only that in homicides and suicides firearms are more likely to be used in seatte than in vancouver to take cook s index as a measure of general firearms availability it must be assumed that the proportional involvement of guns in homicides and suicides is directly related to their relative availability in the general population but this is exactly what the authors are seeking to prove to assume what one is seeking to prove then to prove it on the basis of that assumption does ot constitute scientific evidence for anything even if we were to grant on the basis of no compelling evidence that guns are less common in vancouver we might still question what causes what the authors attribute seattle s higher crime rate to a higher rate of gun ownership but it might well be argued that low crime or homicide rates reduce the motivation for average citizens to obtain guns in other words that crime rates explain the variation in gun ownership not vice versa in fact it was once commonly argued that great britain s low rate of violent crime was a function of that nation s strict gun laws and the consequent low rate of gun ownership until british researcher colin greenwood found that great britain had enjoyed low rates of violent crime for many decades before strict firearms controls were enacted to invoke an ancient methodological saw correlation is not cause nor do the problems with this study end with its lack of direct data on gun ownership the authors say seattle and vancouver are similar in many ways implying that they differ mainly in gun availability gun law stringency and crime rates this is an evident attempt to establish the ceteris paribus condition of a sound scientific analysis that all else is equal among things being compared clearly the two cities are similar in some ways but a closer look reveals differences in ways that are relevant to their respective crime or homicide rates the cities are closely matched in what percentage of their population is white percent and percent but seattle is about percent black while vancouver is less than percent vancouver s minority population is overwhelmingly asian so although the authors show that th two cities are approximately comparable on a half dozen readily available demographic indicators they have not shown that all potentially relevant sources of variation have been ruled out in fact the differences in racial compositions of the two cities is particularly relevant in light of the study s breakdown of homicide rates according to the race of the victim for the white majority the homicide rates are nearly identical per in seattle in vancouver the differing overall homicide rates in the two cities are therefore due entirely to vastly different rates among racial minorities for blacks the observed difference in homicide rate is to and for hispanics to methodoligical complexities render the asian comparison problematic but it too is higher in seattle than in vancouver racial minorities are much more likely to be the victims of homicide in seattle than in vancouver the white majority is equally likely to be slain in either city since the nearly initial difference in homicide reates between the cities is due exclusively to or differences between minority groups it is fair to ask why postulated difference in gun availability or gun law strigency would matter so dramatically to minorities but not matter at all to whites can differential gun availability explain why blacks and hispanics but not whites are so much more likely to be killed in seattle than in vancouver studies in the united states incidentally do not show large or consistent racial differences in gun ownership or are other explanations more plausible could the disparity between canadian and american rates of poverty among racial minorities have anything to do with it what are the relative rates of drug or alcohol abuse of homelessness among each cty s minority population the city of seattle runs the largest shelter for homeless men west of the mississippi unemployment among young central city nonwhite men in the united states usually exceeds percent what is the comparable canadian percentage the crucial point is that canada and the united states differ in many ways as do cities and population subgroups with the two countries absent more detailed analysis nearly any of these many ways might explain part or all of the difference in homicide rates in gross comparisons such as those between seattle and vancouver all else is not equal the authors of this study acknowledge that racial patterns in homicide result in a complex picture they do not acknowledge that the ensuing complexities seriously undercut the main thrust of their argument they also acknowledge that socio economic status is probably an important confounding factor in our comparison remarking further that blacks in vancouver had a slightly higher mean income in than the rest of vancouver s population given the evidence presented in the article it is possible that all of the difference in homicide rates between seattle and vancouver results from greater proverty among seattle s racial minorities but the authors pay no further attention to this possibility since detailed information about household incomes according to race is not available for vancouver the largely insurmountable methodological difficulties confronted in gross comparative studies of this sort can be illustrated with as simple example if one were to take all u s couties and compare them in terms of pervalence of gun ownership and crime or homicide rates one would find an astonishing pattern counties with more guns have less crime would one conclude from this evidence alone that guns actually reduce crime or would one insist that other variables also be taken into account in this example the hidden variable is city size guns are more common in small towns and rural areas whereas crime is a big city problem if researchers failed to anticipate this variable or lacked the appropriate data to examine its possible consequences they coud be very seriously misled in the study at hand the authors matched two cities for size but not for minority poverty rates or other hidden variables and their results are impossible to interpret in the editorial firearm injuries a call for science accompanying the study two officials from the centers for disease control lauded the authors for applying scientific methods to a problem of grave public heath significance but in attempting to draw causal conclusions from nonexperimental research the essence of scientific method is to anticipate plausible alternative explanations for the results and try to rule them out absent such effort the results may well seem scientific but are little more than polemics masquerading as serious research that this study is but one of a number of recent efforts all employing practical

233###comp.graphics###oh make up your mind was re xv problems in article rqisi rhj cc tut fi jk lehtori cc tut fi kouhia juhana writes in article apr nessie mcc ac uk c c lilley mcc ac uk writes in article rohjc avt cc tut fi jk lehtori cc tut fi kouhia juhana writes i wrote something about making color modifications quickly with bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the bit image this makes sense because the main use of xv is only viewing images doing many changes to image we should keep all modifications in a buffer and then before making the operations to bit image we should simplify the operation list for unnecessary operations think about what you are saying here the bit image is quantised down to bits so many similar colours are mapped onto a single palette colour this colour gets modified in fairly arbitrary ways you then want to apply these modifications back to the bit file so you have to find which colours mapped to this one palette colour i suppose you don t know what about we have discussed we discussed about error s in xv which shows images only as bit and my suggestion above works perfectly with it look be consistent first you post something that seems to suggest that you see xv being an bit program as some sort of error so i post and asy it is not a bug it is meant to be like that so you post and say it is not a bug you never said it was i have misunderstood etc now you are saying we discussed about error s in xv which shows images only as bit if you would make up your mind what you are claiming it would make the discussion a lot easier so far i have seen a colormap editing window in xv that is there must be a colormap anyway the problems you present are exist anyway and i didn t tried to solve them at all because i would not make such problems to my programs in the first place eh sorry i don t understand what you are saying here i am aware that english is not your native language and have tried hard to fathom your meaning but this paragraph defeats me gamma and color corrections are easily done to bit image as i presented there s no need make tricks from bit quantized image back to bit image yes as i originally said global changes are easily possible but this statement contradicts what you said earlier i wrote something about making color modifications quickly with bit quantized images and only at the saving the image to file process we have to make the modifications to the bit image how would you suggest doing colour editing on a bit file how would you group related colours to edit them together only global changes could be done unless the software were very different and much more complicated ok you re writing about situation that user want edit images as bit and user want edit individual colors your questions by the way jumps off the discussion a bit no i don t think so actually you were talking about loading a bit image into xv by quantising manipulating the colours in the colour editor then somewhow applying these changes to the bit file when you exit xv xv lets you edit individual colours where is this sudden jumping off the topic my solution doesn t work because there s no colormap withing real bit image yes i am aware there is no colourmap in a bit file you see user see bit image going back to bit is silly i do not understand what this statement is supposed to mean about changing individual colors in bit quantized rasterized image changing individual colors in colormap is useless in most cases if the image is quantized and rasterized small change may make serious errors to anywhere in the image what are you saying xv allows this feature but i don t recommend to use it with the mentioned type images ah now we see thew problem first you want to extend xv to allow editing of bit previews of bit images then i point out problems with this now you are saying there is no problem because you personally happen not to use those parts of the program that cause the problem moreover xv is not a paint program you can only make those global changes not sure what you are saying here certainly one can make local changes in full bit xv changing individual colors sounds like paint program job if person have bit screen there s need for tricks to get the original bit image modified because user don t see full bit image there s need to make approximations and it is not possible to modify individual colors but individual pixels or pixel groups if image is rasterized to select indiavidual color there could be x cursor window which shows true color image in cursor window area selecting individual color is possible from that yes that is one possible approach i would find a program that took such an approach clumsy however ok i don t have thought very much bit painting programs never seen such in good view and are not planned to make such not to mention bit painting program in bit screen well here we agree you have not thought it through very much you don t seem to have a consistent point to make and contradict yourself from one post to the next ok we all have off days perhaps you should step back and think this one through yes again what is was wrong with xv it saved bit quantized rasterized images as bit jpegs jpeg is not designed for that as i said in the last post jpeg is a compression algorithm it is a way of saving disk space by trading off quality against compression i fail to see what the problem is you have not proposed any workable alternatives also human expect that bit will be saved as bit image speak for yourself you are the only person i have met or spoken to who having quantised a bit image down to bits expects this process to somehow reverse when the file is saved keeping all modificvations that heve been made to the bit image palette perhaps that is why you yused the singular say person would like to crop part of the image and save it then it is expected that the image still is the same look next time you import a bit image into xv look carefully at the main control panel it tells you how many colours have been allocated to the bit image xv makes it abundantly clear that you are not editing the original bit file you are the only person who claims this is confusing so xv were designed without thinking about human interface and how human expect the program work design error is a design error the same as a bug read my lips xv is a program for viewing and modifying bit images it lets you import other images it shows i would say a good deal of thought about the human interface and everyone else seems to use it happily for the purpose it was designed for it makes no false claims i have heard xv were designed first for bit images files but it were not good idea to take full bit images without making major change to the original design if you would come up with a solid logical well argued and lucid description of precisely how these proposed extensions would work feel free to post them so far you have not done so so even all screen images are bit the processed images and saved images could have been bit very easily instead of bit argh after all this a comment like that very easily ok go ahead and code it if it is so easy or alternatively look up the terms import and non reversible transformation before anybody will make a note yes i may as well make a lift where up means that the lift goes down and down means that the lift goes up and put a note on this design solution to the manuals however even the manuals tells the correct situation it doesn t solve the problem americans the lift is just an example i think this is a bit of an exageration what you are actually saying is you got into a lift elevator if you are in the states and mistakenly pressed the down button to go up everyone else had no problem now you are trying to sue the manufacturer well my text may be a bit hard reading you bet hopefully you

4367###talk.politics.guns###letter to a liberal colleague l neil smith posted by cathy smith for l neil smith letter to a liberal colleague author s note adrian name changed to protect the guilty and the author are science fiction novelists who once worked with the same editor at a famous new york publishing house dear adrian i m way behind schedule on my current book again so this reply to your note criticizing the recent magazine interview i gave and generally attacking gun ownership will necessarily consist mostly of assertions you re free to believe or not i can back with evidence and logic i ve neither time nor energy to present now i ve written fully on this topic before and will again in the future when i do i ll make sure you get copies there are many arguments i might make from the futility and danger of delegating self defense to the police see don kates in the jan wall street journal to the real effect of prohibition shifting consumers from newly outlawed handguns or semiautomatic rifles to items like sawed off shotguns or homemade bombs but i ll limit myself here to commenting on the newspaper clipping you sent with your note first the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility second publication of some latter day scientific study doesn t alter the fact that the gun prohibitionists i discussed in my interview annoying you so much in the process were lying third the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility fourth as often happens with these things the study doesn t support the gun prohibitionists original numerical contentions anyway but simply adds a new layer of spurious claims to an older body of lies omissions and distortions fifth the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility sixth the fact that gun prohibitionists have been caught lying on countless occasions carl bakal author of no right to keep and bear arms even confessed to it publicly makes the value of this present study dubious to say the least seventh the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility eighth given your own lifelong service as a federal bureaucrat not to mention the cynical sophistication of your fiction you should be better aware than most people how progress in designing studies to prove whatever you want outstrips our ability to collect meaningful data a case in point we might agree on is the fact that it took another kind of prohibitionist or years to create studies proving that pornography causes crime more naive and probably more honest efforts in the s and s clearly indicate the contrary ninth the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility tenth another reason to doubt all such studies is that human behavior as the austrian school of economics demonstrates is far too complex and unpredictable to be meaningfully quantified the attempt to do so and then create public policy based on the resulting pseudo information is wrecking our civilization eleventh the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility twelfth the study is also worthless because it incorporates figures for suicide which is not necessarily a tragedy but basically another individual right sometimes with ancillary social benefits if anything perhaps suicide intervention should be a criminal offense thirteenth and finally the national rifle association officials quoted in the article whatever their shortcomings and they are many are correct in this instance the study is meaningless because the freedom to own and carry the weapon of your choice is a natural fundamental and inalienable human individual civil and constitutional right subject neither to the democratic process nor to arguments grounded in social utility and because of that adrian even if the study were valid it wouldn t deter me from a lifelong personal objective of seeing that anyone can own any weapon he or she prefers and carry it however whenever and wherever he or she desires without asking anybody s permission in this i m ably assisted by gun prohibitionists themselves whose yawping invariably moves previously unarmed people to go out and buy their first gun while they still can before the gun control act most of the shooting fraternity viewed handguns incorrectly as it turned out as inaccurate ineffective toys there probably weren t six million of them in the whole country now thanks to kennedy metzenbaum the bradys and their ilk america s greatest sporting goods sales team we probably manufacture at least that many every year the fascinating datum is that handgun control et al are perfectly aware of this so i guess you ll have to ask them yourself what their real motives are look gun making isn t an arcane or difficult art and by the way it s easier to make a fully automatic weapon than a semiautomatic the fact that i can still obtain my own weapon of preference the self loading pistol is the only thing which keeps me from pursuing this further even if it were difficult there are already a quarter billion firearms in america with an estimated half life of years possibly more for stainless steel guns are gonna be around a long time adrian whether you like it or not as for me to paraphrase elmer keith regardless of what the law provides or any court decides i m always going to be armed and i will always work to see that others are as well the bad news is that there are thousands more perhaps even hundreds of thousands where i come from we can t be stopped by passing laws we can only be forced to arm ourselves and others secretly and given both the practical and alleged differences between full automatics and semiautomatics perhaps more efficiently so what s the point l neil smith author the probability broach

justification for gun control who needs to be convinced that accidental gun deaths of children is a serious problem i assumed that any humane person would be concerned when any year old got hold of their parents gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends any death is serious wanna discuss match control firearms related unintentional deaths among children ages and under are the fault of one or more negligent persons not the gun more than anything gun buyback programs are symbolic offerings to the community in that sense i think they might do a little good please explain why you think symbolic offerings do good my point was gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police departments might i stress might do a little i stress little good by giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way overall i thought that i had made it clear that i did not think that gun buyback programs were useful providing false hope then is the intent i do know that the vast majority of guns that are used by youths or brought to school by youths on a daily basis about youths are obtained easily and quickly through a personal friend or more often borrowed from a parent without their knowledge i suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these statistics i suspect you ll find if you look carefully that is the number of students estimated to have carried a weapon not necessarily a gun to school at least once in the past year and not the number of students who carry a gun to school daily well joe i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence or the centers for disease control if you look carefully you will see that you greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths the cphv reports that youth bring guns to school daily and that bring guns to school at least once a year the cdc estimates that out f high school students carried a gun to school at least once in the cdc also says that million elementary aged latch key children kids who come home from school to an empty house have access to guns in their home california schools reported a increase in student gun confiscations between and and a increase between and florida reported a percent increase in gun incidents in schools between amd these are the statistics increase in california schools eh gun control is working fine there thus willing to follow a man who claimed to be the messiah got news for you folks if the big cheese was on this crazy planet of ours presently he would not be carrying a gun or holding children when they were in danger holding kids time for a reality check son these kids were the children of the people inside who believed that the forces of evil were outside waiting to kill them would you send your children out the door if you believed as they did okay maybe i worded it wrong dad i meant that to put children in a situation fortified compound where harm could come to them is not the act of a messiah in my opinion i m not saying that koresh had control over these children directly but i would hope that whatever messiah there is would not let innocent children die if as he claimed he was the messiah and people followed him as such why did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them burn alive thanks for the reality check joe its been real so your religion is different does that make it his wrong even assuming koresh actually made that decision and the verdict is still out on that

already known well enough to be examined and rebuked by several legislative committees over the years for a longstanding violent disregard of the law invades the home of a man whose religious beliefs and personal habits they abominate violating his rights under the first second fourth fifth ninth and fourteenth amendments to the constitution the man and his followers fight back killing four of the outlaw agency s minions wounding many more and suffering their own losses in the process the agency responds by cutting off his electricity water and especially his contact with the outside world they are then free to say anything at all about him in pronouncements that contradict one another daily as the agency finds itself locked in a bitter power struggle with another outfit eager to gain credit for straightening out the mess and more importantly to script his side of the subsequent negotiations any way they please the impasse lasts almost two months ironically at the same time four l a cops are being given a second trial for brutalizing a single individual sparking one of the ugliest riots in history armored vehicles surround the house already ringed with snipers using scoped high powered rifles loudspeakers playing obnoxious records at the highest possible volume and searchlights deprive those in the house of sleep in the aftermath nobody in authority will mention the effect this technique originated by north korean communists as a battle tactic may have had on their judgment finally another irony on the th anniversary of the rising of the warsaw ghetto some of the armor punches holes in the house and gas of some kind is injected the house bursts into flame and is reduced to ashes in less than an hour at least lives including those of more than a dozen children are snuffed out spokesmen for the outlaw agencies the attorney general and the president all hold press conferences to articulate a common theme blame the victim he had illegal weapons as soon as they can be prepared in a secret government workshop and planted among the cinders being examined by the agency that created them he was abusing children the tapes will be stored with the data on the jfk assassination he set the fire our snipers saw him doing it film at in a d he shot his followers who tried to escape or was that jim jones best of all he s dead he can t say a damn thing to embarrass

on his home is somehow responsible for everything that resulted but when did you ever know of americans to agree on anything doesn t this sound more like the outcome of a soviet election than an opinion poll very well what can we infer from the above for starters never forget that although democratic careers are on the line and rightfully so over this fiasco by the outlaw agency s admission it was planned and rehearsed by a republican administration which may explain why paul harvey who evidently used up all his courage and integrity changing his mind at about the same time i did about the war in viet nam has been acting as little more than a mouthpiece for a state that has no regard for the bill of rights more importantly when rush limbaugh who s been a quivering tower of jello during the whole thing takes essentially the same stance as bill clinton it s time for fundamental changes if not in the system then at least within yourself on march back at the beginning mary gingell national chair of the libertarian party issued a press release condemning the outlaw agency and calling for its abolition in fact the lp has promised in its platform since for at least years to abolish both agencies involved in waco i m proud to say i was there and helped to write that plank true the lp is tiny and insignificant although less so than in ask the democrats in georgia if you doubt it but alone in a howling wilderness of fascists scrambling now to cover their behinds with phony polls and big lies the lp is right about what happened in waco and if their advice had been followed in waco never would have happened think about it and think about the fact that if you ve had enough of political parties more interested in collecting and holding power at whatever cost to the bill of rights let alone human life than in defending and expanding individual liberty maybe the change it s time for within yourself is to make the lp less tiny and insignificant by a single

writes deleted and as far as fully automatic weapons you can be a lot better armed if you want to hit what you aim at what seems to be happening here is the situation getting totally blown out of proportion in my post i was referring to your regular patrolman in a car cruising around the city vs gang members of course the police have access to the things that you mentioned but do they use tanks and such all of the time of course they don t and that s the point i was trying to make every day when i go out to lunch i always see cops coming in the majority that i see are still carrying revolvers not that there is anything wrong with a revolver but if you re a cop that is up against some gang member with a couple of automatics in his coat i mean semi auto handguns you re going to be at a disadvantage even with training i have been at a shooting range where gang gang members were practicing shooting they were actually practicing taking out their guns as quick as possible and shooting at the target and they weren t doing too badly either the university cops here who are are state cops are armed better than the chicago police it seems most state cops are every city and suburban police officer i ve seen around the twin cities in the last two years has carried a semi auto of some type different brands though i haven t seen any glock s with regard to this discussion we are getting dangerously far from the usual rantings of t p g and close to the realm of r g but i d like to put my two cents worth in while there s nothing wrong with a revolver especially a large frame s w in magnum my favorite there are valid advantages to semi autos i suggest reading massad ayoob s i know some people can t stand him and think he s full of bull but i think that in general his material is very valid and useful book the semi auto pistol in police work or something like that he defines a number of ways that semi auto s are different and that different is good the main advantage is not in increased firepower but in more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode there is also a certain propriatory nature of each gun that takes some familiarity to learn this may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar with different models of semi autos but it was cited as stopping or at least slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun define armed better go shoot a revolver and a semi auto like the colt does one fires faster than the other nope aside from which faster rate of fire is usually not desirable sure it makes the other guys duck for cover but just you trying hitting anything with a thompson in hose mode this is why the military is limiting it s m now to round burst fire simple semi auto would be better but the troops like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo something often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful a revolver is equally capable as a semi auto in the same caliber a revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull the trigger again a double action revolver almost all of them can be hand cocked first but will fire merely by pulling the trigger yes but this is best done with a two hand hold with a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock or must fire double action the da semi auto has the same advantages plus is always sa after the first shot a misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again to rotate to the next round i m not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point in a da semi auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same round an advantage you don t have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round discussing this point now this is fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation granted it s very rare but your round will now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go slingshotting the slide on a misfire takes very little time a revolver can be carried with the th chamber empty and under the hammer for maximum safety but still can be drawn and fired with an easy motion even one handed actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not necessary or usually recommended a revolver would have to fall hard enough and at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the round to set it off speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines on semi autos can be faster depending on users the best speedloader users especially those using the spring loaded speed loaders are very fast a problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed this means that while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the gun with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always take more time you also don t have the advantage of tactical reloads replacing a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity the partial magazine can still be used if needed later a misfire in a semi auto will require you to clear a jammed shell first time spent which can be fatal and a vital second or so is often lost as you realize hey it s jammed before starting to do anything about clearing it yes the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear it really though in either a revolver or semi auto the odds of an actual misfire with factory ammo are awfully small you are more likely to get a jam in a semi auto but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns sigs glocks et al most semi autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round and cock the hammer some police carry their semi autos with the chamber loaded and hammer cocked but a safety engaged i do not consider this safe however you must trade off safety to get the same speed of employment as a revolver there are some double action semi autos out there but the complexity of operation of many of them requires more training all common semi auto s can be carried with a round in their chamber without any safety problems while i put that out as a statement that i believe i should say that this applies to all of the ones i ve looked at for the da semi s it s no different from the revolver situation the guns all have hammer or firing pin blocks they also have a safety because there s no real advantage carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed of employment as a revolver plus the advantage of sa followup shots i m not familiar with sa semi autos except for the a i admit that i was initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked but after examining the design trying to defeat the safeties gun unloaded of course and shooting it a lot i see no inherent safety problems with it especially in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer this design also gets you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver some police departments switched to glocks and then started quietly switching many officers back to the old revolvers too many were having accidents partly due to the poor training they received not that glocks require rocket scientists but some cops are baffled by something as complex as the timer on a vcr yeah the infamous glock i still can t figure out how it s worse than a revolver for safety if you don t pull the trigger it doesn t go off i imagine that if all your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the glock trigger far enough to fire before you realized it in addition if you had developed that nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew off your foot then you d have problems when the hammer wasn t there anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the police don t know nothing about firearms turn off cops and hunter and pay attention i do not seek here to say semi autos are junk merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid a cop with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than equipped for anything short of a riot i think this is even okay for a riot as long as it s a small one b gun control is hitting what you aim at if you whip out a wonder nine and fire real fast you may find you don t hit anything good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit i own a mm beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon to something like the ruger security six revolver if i haven t hit what i m aiming at in the first shots something is quite seriously wrong somewheres while i might like having the backup capacity of those extra shots in certain cases overwhelmingly the of shots fired in criminal encounters is less than i have the poor man s beretta taurus and consider it inferior as a carry weapon to the springfield oops mm vs arguments are relegated to r g you are right though if you don t hit what you aim at then the shooter gun combination has failed i don t ascribe failures in the the fire real fast with a wonder nine scenario you mention to the gun this is a shooter failure whether through lack of discipline or lack of training what do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime why the same nice simple revolvers that the police often use well actually some police prefer the much heftier magnum but anyway mm s are becoming more popular with crooks too though the does still lead the list and like i said around here semi auto s seem the rule for the street cop don t know about the state patrol however they may still carry the highway patrolman obplea don t flame me i prefer semi autos for most things but they introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve wracking as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal vincent please don t take any of this as a flame just my whoops looks more like worth and much of it is imho but do check ayoob s book if everything had gone as planned everything would have been perfect batf spokesperson

organization national institute of standards technology distribution na date fri apr gmt lines note the following was released by the white house today in conjunction with the announcement of the clipper chip encryption technology fact sheet public encryption management the president has approved a directive on public encryption management the directive provides for the following advanced telecommunications and commercially available encryption are part of a wave of new computer and communications technology encryption products scramble information to protect the privacy of communications and data by preventing unauthorized access advanced telecommunications systems use digital technology to rapidly and precisely handle a high volume of communications these advanced telecommunications systems are integral to the infrastructure needed to ensure economic competitiveness in the information age despite its benefits new communications technology can also frustrate lawful government electronic surveillance sophisticated encryption can have this effect in the united states when exported abroad it can be used to thwart foreign intelligence activities critical to our national interests in the past it has been possible to preserve a government capability to conduct electronic surveillance in furtherance of legitimate law enforcement and national security interests while at the same time protecting the privacy and civil liberties of all citizens as encryption technology improves doing so will require new innovative approaches in the area of communications encryption the u s government has developed a microcircuit that not only provides privacy through encryption that is substantially more robust than the current government standard but also permits escrowing of the keys needed to unlock the encryption the system for the escrowing of keys will allow the government to gain access to encrypted information only with appropriate legal authorization to assist law enforcement and other government agencies to collect and decrypt under legal authority electronically transmitted information i hereby direct the following action to be taken installation of government developed microcircuits the attorney general of the united states or her representative shall request manufacturers of communications hardware which incorporates encryption to install the u s government developed key escrow microcircuits in their products the fact of law enforcement access to the escrowed keys will not be concealed from the american public all appropriate steps shall be taken to ensure that any existing or future versions of the key escrow microcircuit are made widely available to u s communications hardware manufacturers consistent with the need to ensure the security of the key escrow system in making this decision i do not intend to prevent the private sector from developing or the government from approving other microcircuits or algorithms that are equally effective in assuring both privacy and a secure key escrow system key escrow the attorney general shall make all arrangements with appropriate entities to hold the keys for the key escrow microcircuits installed in communications equipment in each case the key holder must agree to strict security procedures to prevent unauthorized release of the keys the keys shall be released only to government agencies that have established their authority to acquire the content of those communications that have been encrypted by devices containing the microcircuits the attorney general shall review for legal sufficiency the procedures by which an agency establishes its authority to acquire the content of such communications procurement and use of encryption devices the secretary of commerce in consultation with other appropriate u s agencies shall initiate a process to write standards to facilitate the procurement and use of encryption devices fitted with key escrow microcircuits in federal communications systems that process sensitive but unclassified information i expect this process to proceed on a schedule that will permit promulgation of a final standard within six months of this directive the attorney general will procure and utilize encryption devices to the extent needed to preserve the government s ability to conduct lawful electronic surveillance and to fulfill the need for secure law enforcement communications further the attorney general shall utilize funds from the department of justice asset forfeiture super surplus fund to effect this

1810###talk.politics.guns###don kates talk on the branch davidians this was posted by lyn bates to the firearms politics mailing list i recently learned that don kates was going to be in boston to give a talk at the harbard law school about the waco situation of course this was all set up after the incident started but long before its unhappy conclusion so yesterday i went to hear him what follows is a rough summary of what i think i heard him say which should not be taken as exactly what he actually said kates started by saying that since he didn t know any more about the fire than the audience did it had just happened the day before he would not discuss that but would concentrate on the original raid koresh definitely was not playing with a full deck but so what this isn t the first time that the leader of a new small religious group has been ridiculed by the public extreme religious views nearly always fuel hatred and mistrust the first amendment applies maybe especially to people like koresh lengthy digression into the history of police organizations in the us there were none until about when they began in metropolitan areas police originally were not armed if they found a crime in progress they called local armed citizens to help many began to carry arms for protection despite regulations against them eventually the laws were changed to allow them to carry guns the original intent was to have many small police departments jealous of one another and competitive but not large enough to be a threat to liberty hence the plethora of organizations ranging from postal inspectors to the coast guard when the fbi was started agents did not have the authority oto carry guns they were to be after all a bureau of investigation not a police force all police agencies will be misused by anyone in power to maintain that power the batf started as a tax collection agency whose primary job was to raid illegal stills when the price of sugar went up so high that moonshiners no longer found their trade no longer profitable many illegal stills disappeared and the batf needed something else to do to justify its existence so it turned to activities like phony raids on gun stores around the time when the batf s annual budget is under review the media is alerted by the batf to come to such and such a place where at a pre arranged time a bunch of cars full of batf agents roar up to the door and the media get great pictures of the agents entering the premises of a gun dealer suspected of not keeping books properly the media isn t invited in for the boring hours of agents leafing through paperwork but if any irregularities are found the media gets to cover the agents removing armfuls of guns from the premises and the luckless ffl in chains the waco incident happened a few weeks before batf s budget was up for review kates opinion is that it was a staged publicity stunt that went bad and that the batf never thought for a moment that they would actually be shot at or they would have planned the raid differently not sending agents over open ground with no cover for example and would have had some medical personnel on hand he confirmed that some years ago there was a warrant for koresh s arrest in connection with a murder charge and the local sheriff called him on the phone and explained about it koresh sais ok come pick me up and the sheriff did temporarily confiscating all the guns so that they could be tested koresh was later cleared release and presumably got his guns back at least at that time he was rational enough to be approached rationally and behaved in a reasonable manner the batf didn t take into account that unlike most of the ffl s they audit koresh was actually paranoid and fostered paranoia in his followers thus the pubicity stunt looked like a real attack to them and they reacted accordingly with respect to the original warrant it had not been unsealed when kates was giving his talk so he could not comment on it except to mention that the batf has been known to not double check the veractiy of their informants if they can manage to get a judge to issue a warrant he had more to say about the way the warrant was served which may have been completely illegal apparently the proper way to serve a warrant is to knock on the door and announce that you re an officer with a warrant for thus and so if they don t open the door and the evidence is flushable then it is ok to break in the door but since it is hard to flush guns down the toilet there may have been no justification for the batf breaking in the way they did if the constitutional rights of the davidians were violated by an invalid warrant or by an improperly served warrant then the davidians may have been justified in their actons a close look at one of the original films shows that one batf agent may have shot himself by accident when entering the building if so this was the first shot fired the role of the media could have been a whole lot worse after an initial position on the side of the batf the media began to come around to the view that this might be a situation in which legally armed citizens held off a bad possibly illegal attack a real cynic might say that the fbi went in when they did because it was clear that public opinion was beginning to change sides and the fbi wanted to act before they lost the public s sympathy should the batf be abolished no police agencies should be numerous diverse inefficient decentralized etc better a few inept accidents like this than a move toward a single large well organized well trained powerful domestic police force which would eventually have even more tragic results lyn bates bates bbn com ps don kates will be giving a shorter version of this talk at boston

this mentioned a number of times i m curious what is the source for this statistic the number bounces between and depending on the study quoted and the type of gun being studied some cites a recent batf study titled protecting america yes surveyed career criminals and found that only of guns used in violent crimes were purchased from retail dealers national institute of justice research in brief november the armed criminal in america by james d wright legitimate firearms retailers play only a minor role as direct sources of handguns for adult felony offenders only about one sixth of the gun owning felons obtained their most recent handguns through a customary retail transaction involving a licensed firearms dealer the remainder five out of six obtained them via informal off the record transactions involving friends and associates family members and various black market outlets the means of acquisition from these informal sources included cash purchase swaps and trades borrowing and

that most assault weapons in the hands of criminals were obtained through illegal channels the testimony is consistent with the national institute of justice s research findings based on studies of felons in state prisons the nu study authored by sociologists james d wright and peter rossi found that only sixteen percent of criminals had obtained their most recent handgun from a gun store the figures included purchases by legal surrogates rather than directly by the criminal wright and rossi who had begun their research as firm proponents of gun control concluded that no set of controls on retail purchases and probably not even full scale gun prohibition would reduce criminal use of guns wright and rossi suggested that lawmakers concerned about gun crime directly target the black market in criminal guns and leave the legitimate retail market alone not surprisingly wright believes that the consequences of current assault weapon legislation on street violence are likely to be ineffective he warns that gun controls aimed at ordinary citizens are less likely to reduce the pool of criminal guns than to provide organized crime with lucrative new business see e g the anti drug

formats perhaps only surviving on backup tapes but they ll be there and someone will dig them up if that doesn t interest you otis also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your works a

ftp put it in the contrib incoming directory or use uuencode to send it to me email addresses at eof in email after the image is received it will be put into the correct directory computer originated works are also welcome otis directories house two types of image files gif and jpg gif and jpg files require oddly enough a gif or jpg viewer to see these viewers are available for all types of

jpg files to a standard gif format otis also accepts animation files when you submit image files please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to

omaha ne i will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will scan them include an ample sase if you want your stuff back also include information on each image preferably a line description

directory distribution the images distributed by the otis project may be distributed freely on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way save to convert from one image format to another in fact we encourage files to be distributed to local bulletin boards and such if you could please transport the appropriate text files along with the images it would also be nice if you d send me a note when you did post images from otis to your local bbs i just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is it s the purpose of otis to get these images spread out as much as possible if you have the time please upload a few to your favorite bbs system or even just post this info file there it would be keen of you use if you want to use any of the works you find on the otis directory you ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the stipulations of the permission such as free copy of publication or full address credit you will either find this in the rm file for the image or series of images or in the artists directory under the artists name if permission isn t explicitly given then you ll have to contact the artist to ask for it if no info is available email me ed cwis unomaha edu and i ll get in contact with the artist for you or give you their contact information when you do use permitted work it s always courteous to let the artist know about it perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files naming images please keep the names of your files in dos format that means keep the filename before jpg or gif to eight characters or less the way i usually do it is to use the initials of the artist plus a three or four digit code for the series of images plus the series number thus leonardo devinci s fifth mechanical drawing would be something like ldmek gif or ldmek jpg or ldmech gif etc keeping the names under characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems creating image files when creating image files be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture this gives people a reference

style wiring where do i buy stuff subject introduction disclaimers although we ve done a fair bit of wiring we are not electricians and we cannot be responsible for what you do if you re at all uncertain about what is correct or safe don t do it contact someone qualified a licensed electrician or your local electrical inspector electricity is no joke mistakes can result in shocks fires or electrocution furthermore our discussion is based on the u s national electrical code nec and the canadian electrical code cec to the best of our abilities we have confirmed every detail with the electrical code but we don t quote sections simply to keep this thing readable if you think we re wrong we invite you to correct us but please quote references the nec and the cec do not in and of themselves have the force of law many municipalities adopt it en toto others however do not check your with your local building department and provincial hydro inspection offices in canada to find out what applies in your area also your local electrical utility may also have special requirements for electrical service installation bear in mind too that we say here applies primarily to ordinary single family residences multi family dwellings mobile homes commercial establishments etc are sometimes governed by different rules also note that contrary to popular belief in the u s and in some parts of canada canada is not a wholly owned subsidiary of the u s consequently the nec does not apply in canada lots of things are the same including voltages line frequencies and the laws of physics but there are a number of crucial differences in the regulations where we can we ve noted them flagging the relevant passages with nec or cec remember that the cec and nec are minimal standards it is often smart to go beyond their minimal requirements subject what is the nec where can i get a copy the nec is a model electrical code devised and published by the national fire protection association an insurance industry group it s revised every three years the version has been released you can buy a copy at a decent bookstore or by calling them directly at the code exists in several versions there s the full text which is fairly incomprehensible there s an abridged edition which has only the sections likely to apply to most houses and there s the nec handbook which contains the authorized commentary on the code as well as the full text that s the recommended version unfortunately there s no handbook for the abridged edition and the full handbook is expensive us plus shipping and handling subject what is the cec where can i get a copy the canadian standards association is an organization made up of various government agencies power utilities insurance companies electrical manufacturers and other organizations the csa publishes csa standard c which is updated every two or three years each province adopts with some amendments this standard and publishes a province specific code book since each province publishes its own slightly modified standard it would be somewhat confusing to obtain the csa standard itself in this faq cec really means the appropriate provincial standard in particular this faq is derived from the ontario hydro electrical safety code th edition which is in turn based on csa c th edition while differences exist between the provinces an attempt has been made to avoid specific to ontario detail the appropriate provincial code can be obtained from electrical inspection offices of your provincial power authority in ontario it s ontario hydro the ontario hydro book isn t overly fat it s about c and includes mailed updates i hear that these standards are somewhat easier to read than the equivalent nec publications don t bother asking in quebec diy wiring is banned throughout the province subject can i do my own wiring extra pointers in most places homeowners are allowed to do their own wiring in some they re not check with your local electrical inspector most places won t permit you to do wiring on other s homes for money without a license nor are you permitted to do wiring in commercial buildings multiple dwellings eg duplexes are usually considered semi commercial or commercial however many jurisdictions will permit you to work on semi commercial wiring if you re supervised by a licensed electrician if you can find one willing to supervise if you do your own wiring an important point do it neat and well what you really want to aim for is a better job than an electrician will do after all it s your own home and it s you or your family that might get killed if you make a mistake an electrician has time pressures has the skills and knows the tricks of the trade to do a fast safe job in this faq we ve consciously given a few recommendations that are in excess of code because we feel that it s reasonable and will impress the inspector the inspector will know that you re an amateur you have to earn his trust the best way of doing this is to spend your time doing as neat a job as possible don t cut corners exceed specifications otherwise the inspector may get extremely picky and fault you on the slightest transgressions don t try to hide anything from the inspector use the proper tools ie don t use a bread knife to strip wires or twist wires with your fingers the inspector won t like it and the results won t be that safe and it takes longer and you re more likely to stick a hunk of ga wire through your hand that way don t handle house wire when it s very cold eg below c or f thermoplastic house wire particularly older types become very brittle subject what do i need in the way of tools first there s the obvious a hammer a drill a few screwdrivers both straight and phillips head if you re lucky enough to live in canada or find a source of csa approved devices you need robertson square recess screwdrivers and instead of phillips for drilling a few holes a or spade bit and or electric drill will do if you re doing a lot or are working with elderly lumber we recommend a drill right angle drills are wonderful can be rented and or screw point auger drill bits these bits pull you through so they re much faster and less fatiguing even in year old hardwood timbers screw driver bits are useful for drills expecially if you install your electrical boxes using screws drywall screws work well for stripping wire use a real wire stripper not a knife or ordinary wire cutters don t buy the k mart combo stripper crimper and bottle opener types you should expect to pay to for a good plier type pair it will have sized stripping holes and won t nick or grab the wire it should be easy to strip wire with it one model has a small hole in the blade for forming exact wire loops for screw terminals there are fancier types autostrip cut but they generally aren t necessary and pros usually don t use them a pair of diagonal side cutter pliers are useful for clipping ends in constricted places don t use these for stripping wire you will need linesman pliers for twisting wires for wire nuts you should have a pair of needle nose pliers for fiddling inside boxes and closing loops but it s better to form wire loops with a loop former hole on your wire stripper more accurate if you re using non metallic cable get a cable stripper for removing the sheath or do what some pros do they nick the end of the sheath grab the ground wire with a pair of pliers and simply rip the sheath back using the ground wire as a zipper and cut the sheath off you shouldn t try to strip the sheath with a knife point because it s too easy to slash the insulation on the conductors apparently stanley utility knives fitted with linoleum cutters hooked blades can be used to strip sheath but there is still the possibility that you ll gouge the conductors for any substantial amount of work with armored cable it s well worth your while to invest in a rotary cable splitter us hack saws are tricky to use without cutting into the wire or the insulation three prong outlet testers are a quick check for properly wired outlets about multimeters tell you more but are a lot more expensive and probably not worth it for most people a simple voltage sensor which can detect potential through an insulated wire not supplying any devices is extremely helpful they cost about us at radio shack you should have a voltage detector to check that the wires are dead before doing work on them neon bulb version are cheap and work well if you get more serious a audible alarm type is good for tracing circuits without a helper though i ve been known to lock the drill on and hit breakers until the scream stops for running wires through existing walls you need fish tape often two tapes are needed though sometimes a bent hanger or a length of thin chain will suffice fish tapes can be rented electrical tape lots of it seriously a good and competent wiring job will need very little tape the tape is useful for wrapping dicy insulation in repair work another use is to wrap around the body of outlets and switches to cover the termination screws i don t do this but drywall contractors prefer it to prevent explosions when the drywall knife collides with a live outlet that has no cover plate subject what is ul listing the ul stands for underwriters laboratory it used to be an insurance industry organization but now it is independent and non profit it tests electrical components and equipment for potential hazards when something is ul listed that means that the ul has tested the device and it meets their requirements for safety ie fire or shock hazard it doesn t necessarily mean that the device actually does what it s supposed to just that it probably won t kill you the ul does not have power of law in the u s you are permitted to buy and install non ul listed devices however insurance policies sometimes have clauses in them that will limit their liability in case of a claim made in response to the failure of a non ul listed device furthermore in many situations the nec will require that a wiring component used for a specific purpose is ul listed for that purpose indirectly this means that certain parts of your wiring must be ul listed before an inspector will approve it and or occupancy permits issued subject what is csa approval every electrical device or component must be certified by the canadian standards association before it can be sold in canada implicit in this is that all wiring must be done with csa approved materials they perform testing similar to the ul a bit more stringent except that csa approval is required by law again like the ul if a fire was caused by non csa approved equipment your insurance company may not have to pay the claim in canada there is a branch organization of the ul called ulc ul of canada ulc does not have power of law and seems to be more a liason group between the csa and insurance companies subject are there any cheaper easier to read books on wiring usa the following three books were suggested by our readers residential wiring by jeff markell craftsman books carlsbad ca for isbn practical electrical wiring residential farm and industrial based on the national electrical code ansi nfpa herbert p richter and w creighton schwan mcgraw hill book co wiring simplified h p richter and w c schwan park publishing co try to make sure that the book is based on the latest nec revision which is currently canada p s knight authors and publishes a book called electrical code simplified there appears to be a version published specific to each province and is very tied into the appropriate provincial code it focuses on residential wiring and is indispensible for canadian diy ers it is better to get this book than the cec unless you do a lot of wiring or answer questions on the net it is updated each time the provincial codes are this book is available at all diy and hardware stores for less than c subject inspections how and what why should i get my wiring inspected most jurisdictions require that you obtain a permit and inspections of any wiring that is done amongst other more mundane bureaucratic reasons like insurance companies not liking to have to pay claims a permit and inspections provides some assurance that you your family your neighbors or subsequent owners of your home don t get killed or lose their homes one night due to a sloppy wiring job most jurisdictions have the power to order you to vacate your home or order you to tear out any wiring done without a permit california for instance is particularly nasty about this if fire starts in your home and un inspected wiring is at fault insurance companies will often refuse to pay the damage claims in general the process goes like this you apply to your local inspections office or building department for a permit you should have a sketch or detailed drawing of what you plan on doing this is a good time to ask questions on any things you re not sure of if you re doing major work they may impose special conditions on you require loading calculations and ask other questions at this point they will tell you which inspections you will need if you re installing a main panel you will need to have the panel and service connections inspected before your power utility will provide a connection this is sometimes done by the local power authority rather than the usual inspectors after installing the boxes and wiring but before the insulation walls go up you will need a rough in inspection after the walls are up and the wiring is complete you will need a final inspection subject my house doesn t meet some of these rules and regulations do i have to upgrade in general there is no requirement to upgrade older dwellings though there are some exceptions ie smoke detectors in some cases however any new work must be done according to the latest electrical code also if you do major work you may be required to upgrade certain existing portions or all of your system check with your local electrical inspector subject a word on voltages one thing where things might get a bit confusing is the different numbers people bandy about for the voltage of a circuit one person might talk about v another v or another v these are all in fact exactly the same thing in north america the utility companies are required to supply a split phase volt feed to your house this works out as two v legs additionally since there are resistive voltage drops in the house wiring it s not unreasonable to find v has dropped to v or v has dropped to v by the time the power reaches a wall outlet especially at the end of an extension cord or long circuit run for a number of reasons some historical some simple personal orneryness different people choose call them by slightly different numbers this faq has chosen to be consistent with calling them v and v except when actually saying what the measured voltage will be confusing a bit just ignore it one thing that might make this a little more understandable is that the nameplates on equipment ofen show the lower ie v instead of v value what this implies is that the device is designed to operate properly when the voltage drops that low v is not the same as v v is the voltage between phases of a phase y circuit that is v from neutral to any hot v is the voltage between phases of a phase y circuit that s v from hot to neutral in keeping with v versus v strangeness motors intended to run on v three phase are often labelled as v subject what does an electrical service look like there are logically four wires involved with supplying the main panel with power three of them will come from the utility pole and a fourth bare wire comes from elsewhere the bare wire is connected to one or more long metal bars pounded into the ground or to a wire buried in the foundation or sometimes to the water supply pipe has to be metal continuous to where the main water pipe entering the house watch out for galvanic action conductivity breaks often between copper and iron pipe this is the grounding conductor it is there to make sure that the third prong on your outlets is connected to ground this wire normally carries no current one of the other wires will be white or black with white or yellow stripes or sometimes simply black it is the neutral wire it is connected to the centre tap cec center tap in the nec of the distribution transformer supplying the power it is connected to the grounding conductor in only one place often inside the panel the neutral and ground should not be connected anywhere else otherwise weird and or dangerous things may happen furthermore there should only be one grounding system in a home some codes require more than one grounding electrode these will be connected together or connected to the neutral at a common point still one grounding system adding additional grounding electrodes connected to other portions of the house wiring is unsafe and contrary to code if you add a subpanel the ground and neutral are usually brought as separate conductors from the main panel and are not connected together in the subpanel ie still only one neutral ground connection however in some situations certain categories of separate buildings you actually do have to provide a second grounding electrode consult your inspector the other two wires will usually be black and are the hot wires they are attached to the distribution transformer as well the two black wires are degrees out of phase with each other this means if you connect something to both hot wires the voltage will be volts if you connect something to the white and either of the two blacks you will get v some panels seem to only have three wires coming into them this is either because the neutral and ground are connected together at a different point eg the meter or pole and one wire is doing dual duty as both neutral and ground or in some rare occasions the service has only one hot wire v only service subject what is a circuit inside the panel connections are made to the incoming wires these connections are then used to supply power to selected portions of the home there are three different combinations one hot one neutral and ground v circuit two hots no neutral and ground v circuit two hots neutral and ground v circuit neutral and or two v circuits with a common neutral is used for most circuits supplying receptacles and lighting within your house is usually used for supplying power to major appliances such as stoves and dryers they often have need for both v and v or for bringing several circuits from the panel box to a distribution point is usually for special v motor circuits electric heaters or air conditioners note in the us the nec frequently permits a circuit similar to be used for stoves and dryers namely that there are two hot wires and a wire that does dual duty as neutral and ground and is connected to the frame as well as providing the neutral for v purposes three prong plugs instead of four only for stoves dryers connected to the main panel when connected to most sub panels prong plugs and receptacles are required in our not so humble opinion this is crazy but the nfpa claims that this practice was re evaluated for the nec and found to be safe check your local codes or inquire as to local practice there are restrictions on when this is permissible is usually wired with three conductor wire black for hot white for neutral and bare for grounding and have one hot wire coloured red the other black a bare wire for grounding and in a white wire for neutral you will sometimes see wired with just a black white and ground wire since the white is hot in this case both the nec and cec requires that the white wire be permanently marked at the ends to indicate that it is a live wire usually done with paint nail polish or sometimes electrical tape each circuit is attached to the main wires coming into the panel through a circuit breaker or fuse there are in a few locales circuits that look like or except that they have two bare ground wires some places require this for hot tubs and the like one ground is frame ground the other attaches to the motor this may or may not be an alternative to gfci protection subject grounding versus grounded versus neutral according to the terminology in the cec and nec the grounding conductor is for the safety ground i e the green or bare wire the word neutral is reserved for the white when you have a circuit with more than one hot wire since the white wire is connected to neutral and the grounding conductor inside the panel the proper term is grounded conductor however the potential confusion between grounded conductor and grounding conductor can lead to potentially lethal mistakes you should never use the bare wire as a grounded conductor or white wire as the grounding conductor even though they are connected together in the panel but not in subpanels subpanels are fed neutral and ground separately from the main panel usually in the trade and in common usage the word neutral is used for grounded conductor this faq uses neutral simply to avoid potential confusion we recommend that you use neutral too thus the white wire is always except in some light switch applications neutral not ground subject what does a fuse or breaker do what are the differences fuses and circuit breakers are designed to interrupt the power to a circuit when the current flow exceeds safe levels for example if your toaster shorts out a fuse or breaker should trip protecting the wiring in the walls from melting as such fuses and breakers are primarily intended to protect the wiring ul or csa approval supposedly indicates that the equipment itself won t cause a fire fuses contain a narrow strip of metal which is designed to melt safely when the current exceeds the rated value thereby interrupting the power to the circuit fuses trip relatively fast which can sometimes be a problem with motors which have large startup current surges for motor circuits you can use a time delay fuse one brand is fusetron which will avoid tripping on momentary overloads a fusetron looks like a spring loaded fuse a fuse can only trip once then it must be replaced breakers are fairly complicated mechanical devices they usually consist of one spring loaded contact which is latched into position against another contact when the current flow through the device exceeds the rated value a bimetallic strip heats up and bends by bending it trips the latch and the spring pulls the contacts apart circuit breakers behave similarly to fusetrons that is they tend to take longer to trip at moderate overloads than ordinary fuses with high overloads they trip quickly breakers can be reset a finite number of times each time they trip or are thrown when the circuit is in use some arcing takes place which damages the contacts thus breakers should not be used in place of switches unless they are specially listed for the purpose neither fuses nor breakers limit the current per se a dead short on a circuit can cause hundreds or sometimes even thousands of amperes to flow for a short period of time which can often cause severe damage subject breakers can t i use fuses statistics show that fuse panels have a significantly higher risk of causing a fire than breaker panels this is usually due to the fuse being loosely screwed in or the contacts corroding and heating up over time or the wrong size fuse being installed or the proverbial replace the fuse with a penny trick since breakers are more permanently installed and have better connection mechanisms the risk of fire is considerably less fuses are prone to explode under extremely high overload when a fuse explodes the metallic vapor cloud becomes a conducting path result from complete meltdown of the electrical panel melted service wiring through fires in the electrical distribution transformer and having your house burn down breakers don t do this many jurisdictions particularly in canada no longer permit fuse panels in new installations the nec does permit new fuse panels in some rare circumstances requiring the special inserts to key the fuseholder to specific size fuses some devices notably certain large air conditioners require fuse protection in addition to the breaker at the panel the fuse is there to protect the motor windings from overload check the labeling on the unit this is usually only on large permanently installed motors the installation instructions will tell you if you need one subject what size wire should i use for a amp circuit use gauge wire for a amp circuit you can use gauge wire in most locales for a long run though you should use the next larger size wire to avoid voltage drops gauge is only slightly more expensive than gauge though it s stiffer and harder to work with here s a quick table for normal situations go up a size for more than foot runs when the cable is in conduit or ganged with other wires in a place where they can t dissipate heat easily gauge amps we don t list bigger sizes because it starts getting very dependent on the application and precise wire type subject where do these numbers come from there are two considerations voltage drop and heat buildup the smaller the wire is the higher the resistance is when the resistance is higher the wire heats up more and there is more voltage drop in the wiring the former is why you need higher temperature insulation and or bigger wires for use in conduit the latter is why you should use larger wire for long runs neither effect is very significant over very short distances there are some very specific exceptions where use of smaller wire is allowed the obvious one is the line cord on most lamps don t try this unless you re certain that your use fits one of those exceptions you can never go wrong by using larger wire subject what does mean this is used to describe the size and quantity of conductors in a cable the first number specifies the gauge the second the number of current carrying conductors in the wire but remember there s usually an extra ground wire means gauge two insulated current carrying wires plus bare ground wire usually has a black white and bare ground wire sometimes the white is red instead for v circuits without neutral in the latter case the sheath is usually red too wire usually has a black red white and bare ground wire usually carrying v with neutral subject what is a wirenut marrette marr connector how are they used a wire nut is a cone shaped threaded plastic thingummy that s used to connect wires together marrette or marr connector are trade names you ll usually use a lot of them in diy wiring in essence you strip the end of the wires about an inch twist them together then twist the wirenut on though some wirenuts advertise that you don t need to twist the wire do it anyways it s more mechanically and electrically secure there are many different sizes of wire nut you should check that the wire nut you re using is the correct size for the quantity and sizes of wire you re connecting together don t just gimble the wires together with a pair of pliers or your fingers use a pair of blunt nose linesman pliers and carefully twist the wires tightly and neatly sometimes it s a good idea to trim the resulting end to make sure it goes in the wirenut properly some people wrap the open end of the wirenut with electrical tape this is probably not a good idea the inspector may tear it off during an inspection it s usually done because a bit of bare wire is exposed outside the wire nut instead of taping it the connection should be redone subject what is a gfi gfci a gfci is a ground fault circuit interrupter it measures the current current flowing through the hot wire and the neutral wire if they differ by more than a few milliamps the presumption is that current is leaking to ground via some other path this may be because of a short circuit to the chassis of an appliance or to the ground lead or through a person any of these situations is hazardous so the gfci trips breaking the circuit gfcis do not protect against all kinds of electric shocks if for example you simultaneously touched the hot and neutral leads of a circuit and no part of you was grounded a gfci wouldn t help all of the current that passed from the hot lead into you would return via the neutral lead keeping the gfci happy the two pairs of connections on a gfci outlet are not symmetric one is labeled load the other line the incoming power feed must be connected to the line side or the outlet will not be protected the load side can be used to protect all devices downstream from it thus a whole string of outlets can be covered by a single gfci outlet subject where should gfcis be used the nec mandates gfcis for v a or a single phase outlets in bathrooms kitchens within of the sink garages unfinished basements or crawl spaces outdoors near a pool or just about anywhere else where you re likely to encounter water or dampness there are exceptions for inaccessible outlets those dedicated to appliances occupying fixed space typically refrigerators and freezers and for sump pumps and laundry appliances the cec does not mandate as many gfcis in particular there is no requirement to protect kitchen outlets or most garage or basement outlets basement outlets must be protected if you have a dirt floor garage outlets if they re near the door to outside bathrooms and most exterior outlets must have gfcis even if you are not required to have gfci protection you may want to consider installing it anyway unless you need a gfci breaker see below the cost is low in the u s gfci outlets can cost as little as us costs are a bit higher in canada c evaluate your own risk factors does your finished basement ever get wet do you have small children do you use your garage outlets to power outdoor tools does water or melted snow ever puddle inside your garage subject where shouldn t i use a gfci gfcis are generally not used on circuits that a don t pose a safety risk and b are used to power equipment that must run unattended for long periods of time refrigerators freezers and sump pumps are good examples the rationale is that gfcis are sometimes prone to nuisance trips some people claim that the inductive delay in motor windings can cause a momentary current imbalance tripping the gfci note though that most gfci trips are real if you re getting a lot of trips for no apparent reason you d be well advised to check your wiring before deciding that the gfci is broken or useless subject what is the difference between a gfci outlet and a gfci breaker for most situations you can use either a gfci outlet as the first device on the circuit or you can install a breaker with a built in gfci the former is generally preferred since gfci breakers are quite expensive for example an ordinary ge breaker costs us the gfci model costs us there is one major exception if you need to protect a multi wire branch circuit two or more circuits sharing a common neutral wire such as a canadian style kitchen circuit you ll need a multi pole gfci breaker unfortunately these are expensive the cost can range into the hundreds of dollars depending on what brand of panel box you have but if you must protect such a circuit say for a pool heater you have no choice one more caveat gfci outlets are bulky you may want to use an oversize box when installing them on second thought use large actually deep boxes everywhere you ll thank yourself for it incidentally if you re installing a gfci to ensure that one specific outlet is protected such as a bathroom you don t really have to go to all of the trouble to find the first outlet in the circuit you could simply find the first outlet in the bathroom and not gfci anything upstream of it but protecting the whole circuit is preferred when you install a gfci it s a good idea to use the little ground fault protected stickers that come with it and mark the outlets downstream of the gfci you can figure out which outlets are downstream simply by tripping the gfci with the test button and see which outlets are dead subject what s the purpose of the ground prong on an outlet then apart from their use in electronics which we won t comment on and for certain fluorescent lights they won t turn on without a good ground connection they re intended to guard against insulation failures within the device generally the case of the appliance is connected to the ground lead if there s an insulation failure that shorts the hot lead to the case the ground lead conducts the electricity away safely and possibly trips the circuit breaker in the process if the case is not grounded and such a short occurs the case is live and if you touch it while you re grounded you ll get zapped of course if the circuit is gfci protected it will be a very tiny zap which is why you can use gfcis to replace ungrounded outlets both nec and cec there are some appliances that should never be grounded in particular that applies to toasters and anything else with exposed conductors consider if you touch the heating electrode in a toaster and you re not grounded nothing will happen if you re slightly grounded you ll get a small shock the resistance will be too high but if the case were grounded and you were holding it you d be the perfect path to ground subject why is one prong wider than the other polarization nowadays many two prong devices have one prong wider than the other this is so that the device could rely not guaranteed on one specific wire being neutral and the other hot this is particularly advantageous in light fixtures where the the shell should neutral safety or other devices which want to have an approximate ground reference ie some radios most prong extension cords have wide prongs too this requires that you wire your outlets and plugs the right way around you want the wide prong to be neutral and the narrow one hot most outlets have a darker metal for the hot screw and lighter coloured screw for the neutral if not you can usually figure out which is which by which prong the terminating screw connects to subject what kind of outlets do i need in a kitchen the nec requires at least two amp small appliance circuits for kitchens the cec requires split duplex receptacles outlets must be installed such that no point is more than nec mm cec from an outlet every counter wider than nec or mm cec must have at least one outlet the circuit these outlets are on may not feed any outlets except in the kitchen pantry or dining room furthermore these circuits are in addition to any required for refrigerators stoves microwaves lighting etc non dedicated outlets within of a sink must be protected by a gfci nec only split duplex receptacles are fed with a v circuit the tab is broken on the hot side of the outlet and one hot goes to the upper outlet and the other hot goes to the lower outlet the neutral connects to both outlets through one screw when carrying through to another outlet the neutral must be pigtailed such that removing the outlet or having the neutral connection fall off doesn t cause the neutral to disconnect from downstream outlets subject where must outlets and switches be in bathrooms there must be at least one outlet in each bathroom adjacent to the sink in addition to any outlet that may be incorporated in the light fixture all such outlets must be gfci protected subject what is romex nm nmd what is bx when should i use each romex is a brand name for a type of plastic insulated wire sometimes called non metallic sheath the formal name is nm this is suitable for use in dry protected areas ie inside stud walls on the sides of joists etc that are not subject to mechanical damage or excessive heat most newer homes are wired almost exclusively with nm wire there are several different categories of nm cable bx cable technically known as armored cable or ac has a flexible aluminum or steel sheath over the conductors and is fairly resistant to damage teck cable is ac with an additional external thermoplastic sheath protection for cable in concealed locations where nm or ac cable is run through studs joists or similar wooden members the outer surface of the cable must be kept at least mm cec nec from the edges of the wooden members or the cable should be protected from mechanical injury this latter protection can take the form of metal plates such as spare outlet box ends or conduit note inspector permitted practise in canada suggests that armored cable or flexible conduit can be used as the mechanical protection but this is technically illegal additional protection recommendations these are rules in the canadian codes they are reasonable answers to the vague references to exposed to mechanical damage in both the nec and cec nm cable should be protected against mechanical damage where it passes through floors or on the surface of walls in exposed locations under feet from the floor ie use ac instead flexible conduit wooden guards etc where cable is suspended as in connections to furnaces or water heaters the wire should be protected canadian practise is usually to install a junction or outlet box on the wall and use a short length of ac cable or nm cable in flexible conduit to jump to the appliance stapling nm to a piece of lumber is also sometimes used where nm cable is run in close proximity to heating ducts or pipe heat transfer should be minimized by means of a mm air space or suitable insulation material a wad of fiberglass nm cable shall be supported within mm of every box or fitting and at intervals of no more than m holes in joists or studs are considered supports some slack in the cable should be provided adjacent to each box while fishing cable is technically in violation it is permitted where proper support is impractical conductor nm cable should never be stapled on edge knight also insists on only one cable per staple referring to the workmanship clause but this seems more honoured in the breach cable should never be buried in plaster cement or similar finish cable should be protected where it runs behind baseboards cable may not be run on the upper edge of ceiling joists or the lower edges of rafters where the headroom is more than m whenever bx cable is terminated at a box with a clamp small plastic bushings must be inserted in the end of the cable to prevent the clamps forcing the sharp ends of the armor through the insulation bx is sometimes a good idea in a work shop unless covered by solid wall coverings in places where damage is more likely like on the back wall of a garage you may be required to use conduit a ul or csa approved metal pipe you use various types of fittings to join the pipe or provide entrance exit for the wire service entrances frequently use a plastic conduit in damp places eg buried wiring to outdoor lighting you will need special wire eg cec nmw nec uf nmw looks like very heavy duty nmd you will usually need short lengths of conduit where the wire enters exits the ground see underground wiring section thermoplastic sheath wire such as nm nmw etc should not be exposed to direct sunlight unless explicitly approved for that purpose many electrical codes do not permit the routing of wire through furnace ducts including cold air return plenums constructed by metal sheeting enclosing joist spaces the reason for this is that if there s a fire the ducting will spread toxic gasses from burning insulation very rapidly through the building teflon insulated wire is permitted in plenums in many areas canada appears to use similar wire designations to the us except that canadian wire designations usually include the temperature rating in celsius eg ac versus ac in the us nm b is degrees celcius note local codes vary this is one of the items that changes most often eg chicago codes require conduit everywhere there are very different requirements for mobile homes check your local codes especially if you re doing anything that s the slightest out of the ordinary wire selection table incomplete the real tables are enormous uncommon wire types or applications omitted condition type cec nec exposed concealed dry plastic nmd nm armor ac ac teck exposed concealed damp plastic nmd nmc armor acwu teck exposed concealed wet plastic nmwu armor acwu teck exposed to weather plastic nmwu tw etc armor teck direct earth burial plastic nmwu uf service entrance rwu twu armor ra teck acwu nmwu not for service entrance subject should i use plastic or metal boxes the nec permits use of plastic boxes with non metallic cable only the reasoning is simple with armored cable the box itself provides ground conductor continuity u s plastic boxes don t use metal cable clamps the cec is slightly different the cec never permits cable armor as a grounding conductor however you must still provide ground continuity for metallic sheath the cec also requires grounding of any metal cable clamps on plastic boxes the advantage of plastic boxes is comparatively minor even for non metallic sheathed cable you can avoid making one ground connection and they sometimes cost a little less on the other hand plastic boxes are more vulnerable to impacts for exposed or shop wiring metal boxes are probably better subject junction box positioning a junction box is a box used only for connecting wires together junction boxes must be located in such a way that they re accessible later ie not buried under plaster excessive use of junction boxes is often a sign of sloppy installation and inspectors may get nasty subject can i install a replacement light fixture in general one can replace fixtures freely subject to a few caveats first of course one should check the amperage rating of the circuit if your heart is set on installing half a dozen watt floodlights you may need to run a new wire back to the panel box but there are some more subtle constraints as well for example older house wiring doesn t have high temperature insulation the excess heat generated by a ceiling mounted lamp can and will cause the insulation to deteriorate and crack with obvious bad results some newer fixtures are specifically marked for high temperature wire only you may find in fact that your ceiling wiring already has this problem in which case replacing any devices is a real adventure other concerns include providing a suitable ground for some fluorescent fixtures and making sure that the ceiling box and its mounting are strong enough to support the weight of a heavy chandelier or ceiling fan you may need to install a new box specifically listed for this purpose a x across the ceiling joists makes a good support metal brackets are also available that can be fished into ceilings thru the junction box hole and mounted between the joists there are special rules for recessed light fixtures such as pot lamps or heat lamps when these are installed in insulated ceilings they can present a very substantial fire hazard the cec provides for the installation of pot lamps in insulated ceilings provided that the fixture is boxed in a coffin usually x x made by making a pair of joists high and covering with plywood that doesn t have any insulation yes that s feet long nec rules are somewhat less stringent they require at least clearance between the fixture and any sort of thermal insulation the rules also say that one should not obstruct free air movement which means that a cec style coffin might be worthwhile presumably that s up to the local inspector the cec doesn t actually mandate the coffin per se this seems to be an inspector requirement to make absolutely certain that the fixture can t get accidentally buried in insulation ie if you have insulation blown in later there are now fixtures that contain integral thermal cutouts and fairly large cases that can be buried directly in insulation they are usually limited to watt bulbs and are unfortunately somewhat more expensive than the older types before you use them you should ensure that they have explicit ul or csa approval for such uses follow the installation instructions carefully the prescribed location for the sensor can vary there does not yet appear to be a heat lamp fixture that is approved for use in insulation the coffin appears the only legal approach subject what does it mean when the lights brighten when a motor starts this usually means that the neutral wire in the panel is loose depending on the load balance one hot wire may end up being more than v and the other less than v with respect to ground this is a very hazardous situation it can destroy your electronic equipment possibly start fires and in some situations electrocute you ie some us jurisdictions require the stove frame connected to neutral if this happens contact your electrical authority immediately and have them come and check out the problem note a brief second brightening is sometimes normal with lighting and motors on the same v with neutral circuit a loose main panel neutral will usually show increased brightness far longer than one second in case of doubt get help subject what is phase power should i use it can i get it in my house three phase power has three hot wires degrees out of phase with each other these are usually used for large motors because it is more efficient provides a bit more starting torque and because the motors are simpler and hence cheaper you re most likely to encounter a phase circuit that shows volts between any hot and ground and volts between any two hots the latter shows the difference between a normal v v common neutral circuit which is volts between the two hots there are phase circuits with different voltages bringing in a phase feed to your house is usually ridiculously expensive or impossible if the equipment you want to run has a standard motor mount it is much cheaper to buy a new v or v motor for it in some cases it is possible to run phase equipment on ordinary power if you have a capacitor start unit or use a larger motor as a auto generator these are tricky but are a good solution if the motor is non standard size or too expensive or too big to replace the taunton press book the small shop has an article on how to do this if you must note that you lose any possible electrical efficiency by using such a converter the laws of thermodynamics guarantee that subject is it better to run motors at or theoretically it doesn t make any difference however there is a difference is the amount of power lost in the supply wiring all things being equal a v motor will lose times less power in the house wiring than a v motor this also means that the startup surge loss will be less and the motor will get to speed quicker and in some circumstances the smaller power loss will lead to longer motor life this is usually irrelevant unless the supply wires are more than feet long subject what is this nonsense about hp on v a circuits it is a universal physical law that hp is equal to watts given heating loss power factor and other inefficiencies it is usually best to consider hp is going to need watts a v a circuit can only deliver watts to a motor so it cannot possibly be more than approximately hp given rational efficiency factors hp is more like it some equipment manufacturers sears in particular most router manufacturers in general advertise a hp rating that is far in excess of what is possible they are giving you a stall horsepower or similar that means the power is measured when the motor is just about to stop turning because of the load what they don t mention is that if you kept it in that condition for more than a few seconds hopefully your breaker will trip otherwise the motor will melt it s drawing far more current than it can continuously when comparing motors compare the continuous horsepower this should be on the motor nameplate if you can t find that figure check the amperage rating which is always present subject how do i convert two prong receptacles to three prong older homes frequently have two prong receptacles instead of the more modern three these receptacles have no safety ground and the cabling usually has no ground wire neither the nec or cec permits installing new prong receptacles anymore there are several different approaches to solving this if the wiring is done through conduit or bx and the conduit is continuous back to the panel you can connect the third prong of a new receptacle to the receptacle box nec mainly cec frowns on this practise if there is a copper cold water pipe going nearby and it s continuous to the main house ground point you can run a conductor to it from the third prong run a ground conductor back to the main panel easiest install a gfci receptacle the ground lug should not be connected to anything but the gfci protection itself will serve instead the gfci will also protect downstream possibly also two prong outlets if you do this to protect downstream outlets the grounds must not be connected together since it wouldn t be connected to a real ground a wiring fault could energize the cases of prong devices connected to other outlets be sure though that there aren t indirect ground plug connections such as via the sheath on bx cable the cec permits you to replace a two prong receptacle with a three prong if you fill the u ground with a non conducting goop like caulking compound this is not permitted in the nec subject are you sure about gfcis and ungrounded outlets should the test button work we re sure about what the nec and cec say remember though that your local codes may vary as for the test button there s a resistor connecting the load side of the hot wire to the line side of the neutral wire when you press the test button current through this resistor shows up as an imbalance and trips the gfci this is a simple passive and reliable test and doesn t require a real ground to work if your gfci does not trip when you press the test button it is very probably defective or miswired again if the test button doesn t work something s broken and potentially dangerous the problem should be corrected immediately the instructions that come with some gfcis specify that the ground wire must be connected we do not know why they say this the causes may be as mundane as an old instruction sheet or with the formalities of ul or csa listing perhaps the device was never tested without the ground wire being connected on the other hand ul or csa approval should only have been granted if the device behaves properly in all listed applications including ungrounded outlet replacement one of us called leviton their gfcis are labeled for installation on grounded circuits only the technician was surprised to see that he agreed that the nec does not require it and promised to investigate subject how should i wire my shop as with any other kind of wiring you need enough power for all devices that will be on simultaneously the code specifies that you should stay under of the nominal capacity of the circuit for typical home shop use this means one circuit for the major power tools and possibly one for a dust collector or shop vac use at least gauge wire many power tools have big motors with a big start up surge if you can use amp breakers nec though cec requires standard a receptacles which means you d have to replug all your equipment lights should either be on a circuit of their own and not shared with circuits in the rest of the house or be on at least two separate circuits the idea is that you want to avoid a situation where a blade is still spinning at several thousand rpm while you re groping in the dark for the off switch do install lots of outlets it s easier to install them in the beginning when you don t have to cut into an existing cable it s useful if at least two circuits are accessible at each point so you can run a shop vac or a compressor at the same time as the tool you really want but use metal boxes and plates and maybe even metal sheathed cable you may have objects flying around at high speeds if something goes a bit wrong note that some jurisdictions have a no horizontal wiring rule in workshops or other unfinished areas that are used for working what this means is that all wiring must be run along structural members ie stapled to studs other possible shop circuits include heater circuits v circuits for some large tools and air compressor circuits don t overload circuits and don t use extension cords if you can help it unless they re rated for high currents a coiled extension cord is not as safe as a straight length of wire of the same gauge also the insulation won t withstand as much heat and heat dissipation is the critical issue if your shop is located at some remove from your main panel you should probably install a subpanel and derive your shop wiring from it if you have young children you may want to equip this panel with a cut off switch and possibly a lock if you want to install individual switches to safe particular circuits make sure you get ones rated high enough for example ordinary light switches are not safely able to handle the start up surge generated by a table saw buy horsepower rated switches instead finally note that most home shops are in garages or unfinished basements hence the nec requirements for gfcis apply and even if you know that you d never use one of your shop outlets to run a lawn mower the next owner of your house might have a different idea note fine woodworking magazine often carries articles on shop wiring april is one place to start subject underground wiring you will need to prepare a trench to specifications use special wire protect the wire with conduit or special plastic tubing and possibly lumber don t use creosoted lumber it rots thermoplastic insulation and acts as a catalyst in the corrosion of lead the transition from in house to underground wire is generally via conduit all outdoor boxes must be specifically listed for the purpose and contain the appropriate gaskets fittings etc if the location of the box is subject to immersion in water a more serious style of water proof box is needed and of course don t forget the gfcis the required depths and other details vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction so we suggest you consult your inspector about your specific situation a hint buy a roll of bright yellow tape that says buried power line and bury it a few inches above where the wire has been placed subject aluminum wiring during the s aluminum instead of copper wiring became quite popular and was extensively used since that time aluminum wiring has been implicated in a number of house fires and most jurisdictions no longer permit it in new installations we recommend even if you re allowed to that do not use it for new wiring but don t panic if your house has aluminum wiring aluminum wiring when properly installed can be just as safe as copper aluminum wiring is however very unforgiving of improper installation we will cover a bit of the theory behind potential problems and what you can do to make your wiring safe the main problem with aluminum wiring is a phenomenon known as cold creep when aluminum wiring warms up it expands when it cools down it contracts unlike copper when aluminum goes through a number of warm cool cycles it loses a bit of tightness each time to make the problem worse aluminum oxidises or corrodes when in contact with certain types of metal so the resistance of the connection goes up which causes it to heat up and corrode oxidize still more eventually the wire may start getting very hot melt the insulation or fixture it s attached to and possibly even cause a fire since people usually encounter aluminum wiring when they move into a house built during the s we will cover basic points of safe aluminum wiring we suggest that if you re considering purchasing a home with aluminum wiring or have discovered it later that you hire a licensed electrician or inspector to check over the wiring for the following things fixtures eg outlets and switches directly attached to aluminum wiring should be rated for it the device will be stamped with al cu or co alr the latter supersedes the former but both are safe these fixtures are somewhat more expensive than the ordinary ones wires should be properly connected at least way around the screw in a clockwise direction connections should be tight while repeated tightening of the screws can make the problem worse during the inspection it would pay off to snug up each connection note that aluminum wiring is still often used for the main service entrance cable it should be inspected push in terminals are an extreme hazard with aluminum wire any connections using push in terminals should be redone with the proper screw connections immediately there should be no signs of overheating darkened connections melted insulation or baked fixtures any such damage should be repaired connections between aluminum and copper wire need to be handled specially current canadian codes require that the wire nut used must be specially marked for connecting aluminum to copper the nec requires that the wire be connected together using special crimp devices with an anti oxidant grease the tools and materials for the latter are quite expensive not practical to do it yourself unless you can rent the tool any non rated receptacle can be connected to aluminum wiring by means of a short copper pigtail see above shows reasonable workmanship neat wiring properly stripped not nicked wire etc if when considering purchasing a home an inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two we believe that you can consider the wiring safe if there are signs of problems in many places we suggest you look elsewhere if the wrong receptacles are used you can replace them with the proper type or use pigtails having this professionally done can range from to per receptacle switch you can do this yourself too subject i m buying a house what should i do congratulations but it s generally a good idea to hire an inspector to look through the house for hidden gotchas not just for wiring but plumbing and structural as well if an inspection of the wiring shows no problems or only one or two minor ones we believe that you can consider the wiring safe after any minor problems are fixed if there are signs of problems in many places we suggest you look elsewhere here s some hints on what to look for obvious non code wiring can include zip cord wiring either concealed or nailed to walls hot wiring on the identified neutral conductor without proper marking ungrounded grounding outlets except when downstream of a gfci splices hanging in mid air other than proper knob and tube switched neutrals unsecured romex swinging about like grapevines certain wiring practises that are actually to code or were at one time sometimes reveal diy wiring that may have hidden violations switches that seem to control nothing abandoned perhaps not properly terminated wiring a wall switch that shuts off a group of lights that are separately controlled by other wall switches except when it s really convenient switches and outlets in bizarre locations great numbers of junction boxes without outlets or lamps junction boxes with great numbers of wires going into them wiring that passes through a closet instead of a wall or ceiling backwrapped grounding wires subject what is this weird stuff old style wiring in the years since edison invented electricity several different wiring styles have come and gone when you buy an older home you may encounter some of this stuff this section describes the old methods and some of their idiosyncrasies the oldest wiring system you re likely to encounter is called knob and tube k t it is made up of individual conductors with a cloth insulation the wires are run along side structural members eg joists or studs using ceramic stand offs knobs wire is run through structural members using ceramic tubes connections were made by twisting the wire together soldering and wrapping with tape since the hot and neutral were run separately the wiring tends to be rather confusing a neutral often runs down the centre of each room with taps off to each fixture the hot wire tended to run from one fixture to the next in some cases k t isn t colour coded so the neutral is often the same colour as the hot wires you ll see k t in homes built as late as the s comments on k t the people installing k t were pretty paranoid about electricity so the workmanship tends to be pretty good the wire insulation and insulators tend to stand up very well most k t i ve seen for example is in quite good condition no grounding grounding is usually difficult to install boxes are small receptacle replacement particularly with gfci can be difficult no bushing on boxes either so wiring changes need special attention to box entry sometimes the neutral isn t balanced very well between separately hot circuits so it is sometimes possible to overload the neutral without exceeding the fusing on any circuit building code does not permit insulation in walls that contain k t connection to existing k t from new circuits can be tricky consult your inspector modern wiring practise requires considerably more outlets to be installed than k t systems did since k t tends to be in pretty decent condition it generally isn t necessary to replace it simply because it s k t what you should watch out for is renovations that have interfered with it and be cautious about circuit loading in many cases it s perfectly reasonable to leave existing k t alone and add new fixtures on new circuits using modern techniques after k t they invented multi conductor cable the first type you will see is roughly a cloth and varnish insulation it looks much like the romex cable of the last decade or two this stuff was used in the s and s again no grounding conductor it was installed much like modern wiring its major drawback is that this type of insulation embrittles we ve seen whole systems where the insulation would fracture and fall off at a touch bx cable of the same vintage has similar problems this stuff is very fragile and becomes rather hazardous if the wires become bare this wiring should be left untouched as much as possible whenever an opportunity arises replace it a simple receptacle or switch replacement can turn into a several hour long frustrating fight with electrical tape or heat shrink tubing after this wiring technique the more modern romex was invented it s almost a asphalt impregnated cloth often a bit sticky this stuff stands up reasonably well and doesn t present a hazard and is reasonably easy to work with it does not need to be replaced it should be considered as safe as the modern stuff thermoplastic insulation wire just don t abuse it too much subject where do i buy stuff try to find a proper electrical supply outlet near you their prices will often be considerably better than chain hardware stores or diy centres have better quality materials have wider variety including the odd stuff and have people behind the counter that know what you re talking about cultivate friendly knowledgeable sales people they ll give you much valuable information chris

4708###talk.politics.guns###waco clinton press conference part here is a press release from the white house president clinton s remarks on waco with q a to national desk contact white house office of the press secretary washington april following are remarks by president clinton in a question and answer session with the press p m edt the president on february the th four federal agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law against the branch davidian compound which had illegally stockpiled weaponry and ammunition and placed innocent children at risk because the batf operation had failed to meet its objective a day standoff ensued the federal bureau of investigation then made every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life the bureau s efforts were ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were dealing david koresh was dangerous irrational and probably insane he engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency he was moreover responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the action against the compound in february given his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages no provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal agents against the compound this weekend i was briefed by attorney general reno on an operation prepared by the fbi designed to increase pressure on koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully the plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition even in the face of fire and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health but would it was hoped force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender i was informed of the plan to end the siege i discussed it with attorney general reno i asked the questions i thought it was appropriate for me to ask i then told her to do what she thought was right and i take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision yesterday s action ended in a horrible human tragedy mr koresh s response to the demands for his surrender by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his captives as well as all the other people who were there who did not survive he killed those he controlled and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued now we must review the past with an eye towards the future i have directed the united stated departments of justice and treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why and whether anything could have been dne differently i have told the departments to involve independent professional law enforcement officials in the investigation i expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review finally i have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the american people i want to express my appreciation to the attorney general to the justice department and to the federal agents on the front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstances again i want to say as i did yesterday i am very sorry for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in waco i hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like david koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks and i hope very much that the difficult situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what has been learned now q mr president can you first of all tell us why after days you decided q mr president can you describe for us what it is that janet reno outlined to you in your minute phone conversation with the president i can t hear you both if one will go first and then the other q sorry can you describe what janet reno q mr president the president i ll answer both your questions but i can t do it at once q can you describe what she told you on sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it the president yes i was told by the attorney general that the fbi strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound and she described generally what the operation would be that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building and it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside i was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon they were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire in fact as you know an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials there were no shots coming back from the government side i asked a number of questions the first question i asked is why now we have waited seven weeks why now the reasons i was given were the following number one that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there they might be needed in other parts of the country number two that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting koresh and the other cult members to come out number three that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase not decrease with the passage of time and number four that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions so for those reasons they wanted to move at that time the second question i asked the attorney general is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good she said that the fbi personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time the third question i asked was has the military been consulted as soon as the initial tragedy came to light in waco that s the first thing i asked to be done because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation military people were then brought in helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it and so i asked if the military had been consulted the attorney general said that they had and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the fbi and the military something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming significance having asked those questions and gotten those answers i said that if she thought it was the right thing to do that she should proceed and that i would support it and i stand by that today q mr president the president wait go ahead q can you address the widespread perception reported widely television radio and newspapers that you were trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster the president no i m bewildered by it the only reason i made no public statement yesterday let me say the only reason i made no public statement yesterday is that i had nothing to add to what was being said and i literally did not know until rather late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into custody it was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold there was i have i can t account for why people speculated one way or the other but i talked to the attorney general on the day before the action took place i talked to her yesterday i called her again late last night after she appeared on the larry king show and i talked to her again this morning a president it is not possible for a president to distance himself from things that happen when the federal government is in control i will say this however i was frankly surprised would be a mild word to say that anyone that would suggest that the attorney general should resign because some religious fanatics murdered themselves applause i regret what happened but it is not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance these people killed four federal officials in the line of duty they were heavily armed they fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly and they were never fired back on we did everything we could to avoid the loss of life they made the decision to immolate themselves and i regret it terribly and i feel awful about the children but in the end the last comment i had from janet reno is when and i talked to her on sunday i said now i want you to tell me once more why you believe not why they believe why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more and she said it s because of the children they have evidence that those children are still being abused and that they re in increasingly unsafe conditions and that they don t think it will get any easier with time with the passage of time i have to take their word for that so that is where i think things stand q can we assume then that you don t think this was mishandled in view of the outcome that you didn t run out of patience and if you had it to do over again would you really decide that way the president no well i think what you can assume is just exactly what i announced today this is a the fbi has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time this is the same fbi that found the people that bombed the world trade center in lickety split record time we want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way is there something else we should have known is there some other question they should have asked is there some other question i should have asked can i say for sure that no one that we could have done nothing else to make the outcome come different i don t know that that s why i want the inquiry and that s why i would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people not political people but totally non political outside experts who can bring to bear the best evidence we have there is unfortunately a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world and we may have to confront it again and i want to know whether there is anything we can do particularly when there are children involved but i do think it is important to recognize that the wrong doers in this case were the people who killed others and then killed themselves q mr president were there any other options presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from february th until yesterday the president well yes i got regular reports all along the way there were lots of other options pursued if you go back you all covered it very well the fbi you did a very good job of it i mean the fbi and the other authorities there pursued any number of other options all along the way and a lot of them early on seemed to be working some of the children got out some of the other people left there was a at one point there seemed to be some lines of communication opening up between koresh and the authorities and then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward whether there were other in terms of what happened yesterday the conversation i had with the attorney general did not involve other options except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we were pursuing because they said they wanted to do this because they thought this was the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves that s what they thought q did the government know that the children did not have gas masks q congressional hearings once the situation are you in agreement with that the president that s up to the congress they can do whatever they want but i think it s very important that the treasury and justice departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside experts and as i said in my statement if any congressional committees want to look into it we will fully cooperate there is nothing to hide here this was probably the most well covered operation of its kind in the history of the country more more

to reply to what is jpeg jpeg pronounced jay peg is a standardized image compression mechanism jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard jpeg is designed for compressing either full color or gray scale digital images of natural real world scenes it does not work so well on non realistic images such as cartoons or line drawings jpeg does not handle black and white bit per pixel images nor does it handle motion picture compression standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees named jbig and mpeg respectively jpeg is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn t quite identical to what you originally put in the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details aren t perceived as well as small details of light and dark thus jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans if you plan to machine analyze your images the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality you can make extremely small files if you don t mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc conversely if you aren t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression why use jpeg there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store bit per pixel color data instead of bit per pixel data making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images being able to compress a mbyte full color file down to kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time if you are comparing gif and jpeg the size ratio is more like four to one more details below if your viewing software doesn t support jpeg directly you ll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images even with a jpeg capable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance thus using jpeg is essentially a time space tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply it s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file i ll let you do the arithmetic yourself the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information bits pixel million colors instead of or less or fewer colors if you have only bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you within a couple of years though bit gif will look as obsolete as black and white macpaint format does today furthermore for reasons detailed in section jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif jpeg is not going to displace gif entirely for some types of images gif is superior in image quality file size or both one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to as a rule of thumb jpeg is superior to gif for storing full color or gray scale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and similar material jpeg is superior even if you don t have bit display hardware and it is a lot superior if you do see section for details gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings in particular large areas of pixels that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif jpeg can t squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects this sort of image is best kept in gif form in particular single color borders are quite cheap in gif files but they should be avoided in jpeg files jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pure black pixels adjacent to a row of pure white pixels for example sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in gif files borders overlaid text etc the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that s only a few pixels high if you have a gif with a lot of small size overlaid text don t jpeg it computer drawn images ray traced scenes for instance usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity the more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same goes for semi realistic artwork fantasy drawings and such plain black and white two level images should never be converted to jpeg you need at least about gray levels before jpeg is useful for gray scale images it should also be noted that gif is lossless for gray scale images of up to levels while jpeg is not if you have an existing library of gif images you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg you will lose a little image quality if you do section which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif only applies if both formats start from a full color original if you start from a gif you ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information jpeg can only make things worse however the disk space savings may justify converting anyway this is a decision you ll have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section for hints be prepared to leave some images in gif format since some gifs will not convert well how well does jpeg compress images pretty darn well here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy a x full color image of a ship in a harbor the first three files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section b file size in bytes comments ship ppm original file in ppm format no compression bits or bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead ship ppm z ppm file passed through unix compress compress doesn t accomplish a lot you ll note other text oriented compressors give similar results ship gif converted to gif with ppmquant fs ppmtogif most of the savings is the result of losing color info gif saves bits pixel not see sec ship jpg cjpeg q highest useful quality setting this is indistinguishable from the bit original at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs ship jpg cjpeg q default setting you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original even with both on screen at once ship jpg cjpeg q this has slight defects if you know what to look for you could tell it s been jpeged without seeing the original still as good image quality as many recent postings in usenet pictures groups ship jpg cjpeg q jpeg s characteristic blockiness becomes apparent at this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some still i ve seen plenty of usenet postings that were of poorer image quality than this ship jpg o cjpeg q optimize optimize cuts table overhead blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or indexing purposes note that this file is tiny the compression ratio from the original is in this case jpeg can make a file that s a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality the q file is every bit as good as the gif better if you have a full color display this seems to be a typical ratio for real world scenes what are good quality settings for jpeg most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings quality does not mean keep of the information as some have claimed the quality scale is purely arbitrary it s not a percentage of anything the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb the default quality setting q is very often the best choice this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image try q first if you see defects then go up except for experimental purposes never go above q saying q will produce a file two or three times as large as q but of hardly any better quality if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to q without objectionable degradation on the other hand you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg the default q is about right for compressing bit images but q to is usually better for converting gifs see section for more info if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are prepared to tolerate large defects a q setting in the range of to is about right q or so may be amusing as op art note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section b and to many programs based on it other jpeg implementations such as image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale some programs don t even provide a numeric scale just high medium low style choices where can i get jpeg software most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp if you don t know how to use ftp see the faq article how to find sources if you don t have direct access to ftp read about ftpmail servers in the same article that article appears regularly in news answers or you can get it by sending e mail to mail server rtfm mit edu with send usenet news answers finding sources in the body the anonymous ftp list faq may also be helpful it s usenet news answers ftp list faq in the news answers archive note this list changes constantly if you have a copy more than a couple months old get the latest jpeg faq from the news answers archive a if you are looking for canned software viewers etc the first part of this list is system specific programs that only run on one kind of system if you don t see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet but some commercial programs are listed too x windows xv shareware is an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and many other image formats it can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations it s available for ftp from export lcs mit edu file contrib xv tar z version is a major upgrade with support for bit displays and many other improvements however it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking if you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge stick with version also available from export note that version is not a good choice if you have a bit display you ll get only bit color nor for converting bit images to jpeg but works fine for converting gif and other bit images to jpeg caution there is a glitch in version be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a jpeg file or the file will be blurry another good choice for x windows is john cristy s free imagemagick package also available from export lcs mit edu file contrib imagemagick tar z this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks the imagemagick viewer handles bit displays correctly for colormapped displays it does better though slower color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software both of the above are large complex packages if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release xloadimage is free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib xloadimage tar z xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg files because it has the ijg v decoder while xloadimage is using a hacked over v the next xloadimage release will fix this xli is also free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib xli tar z both programs are said to do the right thing with bit displays ms dos this covers plain dos for windows or os programs see the next headings one good choice is eric praetzel s free dvpeg which views jpeg and gif files the current version is available by ftp from sunee uwaterloo ca file pub jpeg viewers dvpeg zip this is a good basic viewer that works on either or machines the user interface is not flashy but it s functional another freeware jpeg gif tga viewer is mohammad rezaei s hiview the current version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics hv zip hiview requires a or better cpu and a vcpi compatible memory manager qemm and max work windows and os do not hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen for larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen rather than using panning scrolling as most viewers do you may or may not prefer this approach but there s no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably note installation is a bit tricky read the directions carefully a shareware alternative is colorview for dos this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives its user interface is also much spiffier looking although personally i find it harder to use more keystrokes inconsistent behavior it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview at least on my hardware for images larger than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than hiview the current version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics dcview zip requires a vesa graphics driver if you don t have one look in vesadrv zip or vesa tsr zip from the same directory many recent pcs have a built in vesa driver so don t try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing a second shareware alternative is fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but i don t know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel archives at that time the well known gif viewer compushow cshow supports jpeg in its latest revision a however cshow s jpeg implementation isn t very good it s slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is poor except on hi color displays too bad it d have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow shareware available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos gif cshw a zip due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine if you can t get any of them to work you ll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif then view with your favorite gif viewer if you have hi color hardware don t use gif as the intermediate format try to find a targa capable viewer instead vpic is reputed to do the right thing with hi color displays the independent jpeg group s free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics jpeg zip or jpeg zip if you have a and extended memory these files are dos compilations of the free source code described in section b they will convert jpeg to and from gif targa and ppm formats handmade software offers free jpeg gif conversion tools gif jpg jpg gif these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format in particular you can t get bit color output from a jpeg the major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsi s proprietary jpeg format as well as the usenet standard jfif format since hsi format files are rather widespread on bbses this is a useful capability version of these tools is free prior versions were shareware get it from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics gif jpg zip note do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet since it is not readable on non pc platforms handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package image alchemy this will translate jpeg files both jfif and hsi formats to and from many other image formats it can also display images a demo version of image alchemy version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics alch zip note about simtel the internet s key archive site for pc related programs is simtel full name wsmr simtel army mil simtel runs a non unix system with weird directory names where this document refers to directory eg msdos graphics at simtel that really means pd msdos graphics if you are not physically on milnet you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel there are several internet sites that maintain copies mirrors of the simtel archives most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead a popular usa mirror site is oak oakland edu which keeps simtel files in eg pub msdos graphics if you have no ftp capability you can retrieve files from simtel by e mail see informational postings in comp archives msdos announce to find out how if you are outside the usa consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel mirror is microsoft windows there are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware due to windows system overhead note that you can run the dos conversion programs described above inside a windows dos window the newest entry is winecj which is free and extremely fast version is available from ftp rahul net file pub bryanw pc jpeg wecj zip requires windows and or more colors mode this is a no frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers but it s so fast you ll use it anyway at least for previewing jview is freeware fairly fast has good on line help and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format but it can t create new jpeg files and it doesn t view gifs jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but it s an excellent basic viewer the current version is available from ftp cica indiana edu file pub pc win desktop jview zip mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites including wuarchive wustl edu winjpeg shareware displays jpeg gif targa tiff and bmp image files it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter it has some other nifty features including color balance adjustment and slideshow the current version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note above file msdos windows winjp zip this is a slow compatible version if you register you ll get the only version which is roughly faster colorview is another shareware entry this was an early and promising contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it has no real advantages over winjpeg if you want to try it anyway the current version is available from ftp cica indiana edu file pub pc win desktop cview zip i understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with colorview for dos dvpeg see dos heading also works under windows but only in full screen mode not in a window os the following files are available from hobbes nmsu edu note check pub uploads for more recent

jpeg implementation which is part of the quicktime system extension so you need to have quicktime installed to use quicktime you need a or better cpu and you need to be running system or later if you re running system you must also install the bit quickdraw extension this is built in on system you can get quicktime by ftp from ftp apple com file dts mac quicktime quicktime hqx as of this file contains quicktime which is better than qt in several ways with respect to jpeg it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file however some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt mac users should keep in mind that quicktime s jpeg format pict jpeg is not the same as the usenet standard jfif jpeg format see section for details if you post images on usenet make sure they are in jfif format most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format the first choice is probably jpegview a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format pict jpeg format or gif format it also can convert between the two jpeg formats the current version is a big improvement over prior versions get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app jpeg view hqx requires system and quicktime on bit displays jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers in fact it s the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over x pixels on a typical mb mac given a large image jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers you can zoom in on any desired portion though some people like this behavior some don t overall jpegview s user interface is very well thought out gifconverter a shareware image viewer converter supports jfif and pict jpeg as well as gif and several other image formats the latest version is get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac art gif gif converter hqx requires system or later gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeg gif viewer but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images also the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images without quicktime so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime but it s faster with quicktime note if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert then viewing the gif version jpeg convert a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities is available from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app jpeg convert hqx this will run on any mac but it only does file conversion not viewing you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v a jpeg gif converter based on an old version of the ijg code if you are using this program you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert apple s free program pictpixie can view images in jfif quicktime jpeg and gif format and can convert between these formats you can get pictpixie from ftp apple com file dts mac quicktime qt stuff pictpixie hqx requires quicktime pictpixie was intended as a developer s tool and it s really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface worse pictpixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix there is an old version of pictpixie called pictcompressor floating around the net if you have this you should trash it as it s even buggier also the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleaned up descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net storm technology s picture decompress is a free jpeg viewer converter this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without system or quicktime so you may be forced to use it on older systems it does need bit quickdraw so really old machines can t use it you can get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app picture decompress hqx you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to jpeg to allow picture decompress to open it if your machine is too old to run bit quickdraw a mac plus for instance gifconverter is your only choice for single program jpeg viewing if you don t want to pay for gifconverter use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg although not all can deal with the usenet standard jfif format adobe photoshop version or later can read and write jfif format jpeg files use the jpeg plug in from the acquire menu you must set the file type of a downloaded jpeg file to jpeg to allow photoshop to recognize it amiga most programs listed in this section are stored in the aminet archive at amiga physik unizh ch there are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one in the usa a good choice is wuarchive wustl edu look

while older versions can be found on some archimedes bboards the current version is only available by registering with the author john kortink nutterbrink wj enschede the netherlands price dutch guilders about or pounds there s also a commercial product called jpeg which provides jpeg read write functionality and direct jpeg viewing as well as a host of other image format conversion and

fits your situation you can obtain and compile the free jpeg conversion software described in b you ll also need a viewer program if your display is bits or less any gif viewer will do fine if you have a display with more color capability try to find a viewer that can read targa or ppm bit image files there are numerous commercial jpeg offerings with more popping up every day i recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow in that case purchase a hardware assisted product ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final jpeg standard and about whether it can handle the jfif file format many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else s

that s free we offer no warranty and accept no liability the independent jpeg group is a volunteer organization if you d like to contribute to improving our software you are welcome to join what s all this hoopla about color quantization most people don t have full color bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware stores or fewer bits per pixel so it can display or fewer distinct colors at a time to display a full color image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors this process is called color quantization this is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term we re stuck with the standard usage though clearly color quantization is a lossy process it turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings since jpeg is a full color format converting a color jpeg image for display on bit or less hardware requires color quantization this is true for all color jpegs even if you feed a or less color gif into jpeg what comes out of the decompressor is not colors but thousands of colors this happens because jpeg s lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray scale output incidentally because of this effect it s nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences i occasionally see posted images described as color jpeg this tells me that the poster a hasn t read this faq and b probably converted the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classified as color or gray scale just like photographs but number of colors just isn t a useful concept for jpeg on the other hand a gif image by definition has already been quantized to or fewer colors a gif does have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format doesn t allow more than palette entries for purposes of usenet picture distribution gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients don t have to this is also the disadvantage of gif you re stuck with the sender s quantization if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to re quantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full color image furthermore if the sender didn t use a high quality color quantization algorithm you re out of luck for this reason jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don t match the sender s display hardware jpeg s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user s display hardware furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of jpeg images you already have with a gif you re stuck forevermore with what was sent it s also worth mentioning that many gif viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines if you view a color gif on a color ega display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations one to create the gif one to display it but often it s also due to sloppiness jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed thus jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for low color resolution displays as well as high resolution ones finally an ever growing number of people have better than bit display hardware already bit hi color pc displays true bit displays on workstations and macintoshes etc for these people gif is already obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively thus jpeg is an all around better choice than gif for representing images in a machine independent fashion how does jpeg work the buzz words to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding this article s long enough already so i m not going to say more than that here for technical information see the comp compression faq this is available from the news answers archive at rtfm mit edu in files pub usenet news answers compression faq part if you need help in using the news answers archive see the top of this article what about lossless jpeg there s a great deal of confusion on this subject the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm i e one that guarantees the final output is bit for bit identical to the original input however this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offers much less compression at present very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist and all of them are commercial saying q to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step with the v free jpeg code you can also say sample x to turn off subsampling keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value it s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image at this minimum loss setting regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed bit per pixel image true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bit for bit accuracy if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with or more bits per pixel furthermore jpeg is public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents why all the argument about file formats strictly speaking jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms it does not refer to a specific image file format the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations since we can t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem in the absence of official standards a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs aren t compatible with anybody else s the closest thing we have to a de facto standard jpeg format is some work that s been coordinated by people at c cube microsystems they have defined two jpeg based file formats jfif jpeg file interchange format a low end format that transports pixels and not much else tiff jpeg aka tiff an extension of the aldus tiff format tiff is a high end format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides tiff is a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets of tiff it s not likely that adding jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpeg related products it s reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the tiff spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details even when tiff jpeg is well defined the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator tiff jpeg files may never be as transportable a particular case that people may be interested in is apple s quicktime software for the macintosh quicktime uses a jfif compatible format wrapped inside the mac specific pict structure conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward and several mac programs are available to do it see mac portion of section a if you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section for details another particular case is handmade software s programs gif jpg jpg gif and image alchemy these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi this format is not readable by any non hsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings use the j switch to get jfif output this applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif format by default you still should be careful not to post hsi format files unless you want to get flamed by people on non pc platforms how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software won t read it s likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg based format you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file a jfif standard file will start with the characters hex ff d ff e followed by two variable bytes often hex followed by jfif if you see ff d at the start but not the rest of it you may have a raw jpeg file this is probably decodable as is by jfif software it s worth a try anyway hsi files start with hsi you re out of luck unless you have hsi software portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they won t decompress properly with non hsi programs a macintosh pict file if jpeg compressed will have a couple hundred bytes of header followed by a jfif header scan for jfif strip off everything before the ff d and you should be able to read it anything else it s a proprietary format or not jpeg at all if you are lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d try stripping off everything before that in uuencoded usenet postings the characteristic jfif pattern is begin line m c x whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with begin line m i if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non jfif files what about arithmetic coding the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed the choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file on typical images arithmetic coding produces a file or percent smaller than huffman coding all the file size numbers previously cited are for huffman coding unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm at t and mitsubishi thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses from these companies the fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best at least in the short run i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding the space savings isn t great enough to justify the potential legal hassles in particular arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future stay tuned for further details does loss accumulate with repeated compression decompression it would be nice if having compressed an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially unfortunately this is not the case in general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without changing it then there is no further loss i e you get an identical jpeg file even this is not true at least not with the current free jpeg software it s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first generation output it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change one of the things on our to do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but i am not optimistic about it in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full color output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff error degradation if you re wondering why it s because the pixel block boundaries move if you cropped off only multiples of pixels you might be safe but that s a mighty limited capability the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you don t want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while working on the image then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compression decompression time this way what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg as stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg if you can obtain the original full color data the gif was made from it s far better to make a jpeg from that but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding gif that will give you a chance to re do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary some gifs may be better left as gifs as explained in section in particular cartoon type gifs with sixteen or fewer colors don t convert well you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be larger than the gif so check the sizes too experience to date suggests that large high visual quality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to jpeg with least degradation don t waste your time converting any gif much under kbytes also don t expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from full color originals to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight through jpeg files would be i e shoot for or rd the size of the gif file not th as suggested in earlier comparisons many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant color border around a gif image while useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files it is not free in jpeg files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging if you are on an x windows system xv s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this cjpeg s default q setting of is appropriate for full color input but for gif inputs q settings of to often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation if you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher q setting may not be necessary color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the colors that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value the trouble with dithering is that to jpeg it looks like high spatial frequency color noise and jpeg can t compress noise very well the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you had it to get around this you want to smooth the gif image before compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a better looking output image than you d get without smoothing with the v free jpeg software or products based on it a simple smoothing capability is built in try smooth or so when converting gifs values of to seem to work well for high quality gifs heavy handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors if you can see regular fine scale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you don t want if you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package however cjpeg s built in smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol the upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality smooth is probably a good starting point for converting gifs but if you really care about the image you ll want to check the results and maybe

ocom okstate edu writes stuff about british cult members deleted what exactly are you trying to say and why were there no fire engines within a mile of the compound because the gun loonies were firing on vehicles with mm amunition that has a range of meters they were using caliber ammunition not mm ammo mm would be cm a shell of this size would be larger than a lot of cannon shells snipers could have screened the people trying to put out the fire besides the ranch house not fort apocalypse it was just a house despite what the fbi and atf says was on fire the gun loonies couldn t hardly have been shooting at fire men while there house was engulfed in flames the fbi and atf don t have any excuse for not having fire engines there to put out the blaze the bastards waited until the fire was well under way before they called the fire department in waco they didn t even tell the fire department to be on standby i sincerely hope that the fbi atf attorney general janet reno and all others involved in this fiasco get the just punishment that they so richly deserve someone should pay for this needless tragic waste of human life sadly these evil sobs will probably never face justice the media and the government will just whitewash this incident and chalk it up as being solely david koresh s fault sadder still the american people will probably believe them next question the problem is of course the laws that allow a bunch of raving nutters to collect a huge stack of arms in the first place this is not the problem the problem is that we have a government that is becoming more tyrannical every day if people decide to own guns and live in one place together then that is their prerogative on the other hand if the bds were in posession of explosives and illegal guns then the government did have the right to search their compound but the allegations that the bds were in posession of illegal weapons hasn t been proven yet so i m not going to conclude that the bds broke any laws david koresh was accused of abusing children but if this is his only crime then the presence of the atf can t be justified the atf is only supposed to deal with firearms tobacco and alcohol violations atf agents are basically cigarette cops they should stay out of other kinds of law enforcement actions that are out of their jurisdiction better yet they should be s tcanned imo the sequence of events meant that there really was no option but to attempt some sort of breakthrough via an intervention if the fbi had had the stomach for it they could have mounted a commando type raid and attempted to save the children by shooting all the adults sounds like something the ss would do human life children and adults alike should be treated with respect even if they are heavily armed religious wackos david koresh s lawyer seemed to think that everyone would come out peacefully sooner or later the fbi and atf had nothing but time on their hands why did they have to escalate the situation and cause this senseless tragedy their job is to protect the public and save lives not kill people for crying out loud it really was a no win situation koresh had plenty of opportunity to give up and stand trial for the murder of the atf officers instead he ordered the murder of the children don t be so sure about that i read in a newspaper today that one of the cult members said that when one of the tanks went through the wall that it knocked over a lantern which caused the ranch house to be caught on fire this cult member also said that david koresh had no intentions of committing mass suicide david koresh s lawyer also confirms this therefore if this is true then this means that the fbi and atf murdered everyone in that house even if this is not true the fbi and atf still don t get off the hook because they waited a damn long time to call the waco fire department perhaps they wanted all these people to die in order to reject the word of the fbi and batf it is neccessary to beleive the words of a man who has just murdered children and ordered the suicide murder of his other followers according to the account given the batf attempted to serve a warrant upon koresh at the ranch and were met by gunfire in a deliberate attempt to murder them the koresh gun supporter claim that the batf started shooting simply does not stand up if the aft had gone there to start shooting they would have gone with heavier grade weaponry than standard issue handguns for all practical purposes they were unarmed the b d followers had automatic weapons you re wrong on several accounts atf agents were adequately armed they had mp s ar s and shotguns some agents were armed with automatic pistols but not all were the atf s initial claim which they later retracted that agents were underarmed is simply ludicrous the b d seige could not be allowed to go on indefinitely the b d were quite capable of commiting mass suicide and murdering the children at any time a commando assault was the only other likely action that could have achieved that objective that would have been very risky orders of magintude harder than antebbe or the iranian embassy seige airplanes and embassies are not designed for defense against attack ranch apocalypse was terrorists are far easier to disloge without casualties than allowing the siege to go on was not an option either besides the serious risk that koresh would proclaim armageddon at any moment there was the question of the difficulties of keeping the emmergency team on standby over a prolonged period the longer the siege went on the more mentally prepared koresh and his followers would be for a prolonged siege rather than go in prematurely the mistake was probably to go in too soon can you think of a better way of getting the children out a certain way the people who do not want gun control must obviously discount the entire government story this is simply rationalisation it is not enough for them to simply dismiss the government as incompetent that would require them to come up with a solution themselves instead they have to come up with a government conspiracy theory whereby the government decided to set out to murder people just to set up some sort of scare to alow them to get gun control legislation through gun control isn t the only issue here if the sick little monkeys in washington try to use the waco incident as a reason to ban guns then they will have demonstrated just how f ed up they are what concerns me much more than new gun control legislation is that the government seems to be able to get away with s t like they did in waco they are becoming more and more callous about people s rights and the law this greatly disturbs me and it should disturb you as well this conspiracy theory assumes that the batf deliberately got of its agents killed and that the fbi etc actually enjoy sitting out in the middle of texas being shot at by religious nutters still the conspiracy theory is comforting it allows them to pretend that waco proves nothing except about how incompetent the government is in resolving a hostage crisis no govt in the world has ever faced a comparable situation quite probably there was no manner in which it could be peacefully resolved the blame does not rest on the fbi it rests on the fact that koresh was allowed to get so far in particular the person who tipped the b d off in advance has the murder of atf agents and children on his or her conscience there are a large number of people in the us who predict the end of society preach salvation through armed security the fact is that these are the very people who pose the threat to society in the first place the next waco may not be religious nutters but a political movement a splinter group of the klu klux klan taking over a schoolhouse in a black area for example and holding several hundred children hostage the only possible solution to such situations that can work is to prevent them arising no other government in the world has faced such a situation this is because no other government has so carelessly allowed high power weaponry to become avaliable to any little hitler or would be

4791###talk.politics.guns###re jffo has gone a bit too far having read the posted long article by jpfo i have some observations this article does not claim that the gca of is a verbatim translation of a nazi law what it says is that in another place the book they re talking about they compare the two things section by section the implication is that the similarities are devastating in the next sentence they talk about how in that book they reproduce the german text of the nazi law together with its translation not surprisingly a reader could easily conflate these two things into a single idea that the american gca is a literal translation of the nazi law and sure enough that s what the whole thing has mutated into urban folklore style the article goes to great pains to establish that senator dodd had a copy of the nazi law either from his time on the nurnberg prosecution team or later this fact is considered highly incriminating but i don t understand why the author repeats several times that he is simply unable to imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text and yet in a paragraph towards the end he explains it perfectly if dodd got his copy of the original german text of the nazi weapons law during his time at nurnberg it likely was part of a collection of documents for example issues of the reichsgesetzblatt the german law registry bingo exactly dodd had a book with a series of nazi laws in it including the one under discussion all of the stuff about why would a u s congressman have a copy of a nazi law melts away by the author s admission he then continues but if he acquired the original german text of the nazi weapons law after his service at nurnberg he must have done so for a very specific reason but there s absolutely no reason to think that this is the case in fact as a senior member of the u s team that helped to prosecute nazi war criminals it seems to me that he would have had to have a copy all arguments about whether the nazi weapon law is really of historical interest as it obviously is certainly according to the author here or whether dodd personally prosecuted the interior minister who signed it can be put aside as red herrings having established that dodd owned a copy of the original german text the jpfo article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he asked to have it translated the problem is in the context of the charge levelled at dodd these two things work against each other people ask to have things translated when they don t know what they mean if dodd took it upon himself to preserve the nazi law with idea of someday introducing it into american law surely by he would have know what it meant wouldn t he anyway this precise charge the main one that i questioned in an earlier posting is just silly why would dodd need the exact translation for this purpose is the idea that the gun controllers despite being presumably bent on disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil liberties needed a crib sheet didn t they have any idea how to do it on their own once again the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his own question dodd may have offered his copy of the nazi weapons law to show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the nazi law in fact since the law and its translation were entered into the congressional record under the heading of documents concerning the history of nazism and gun confiscation dodd s motivation isn t a mystery he asked for the translation in order to put it in the cr even this article makes it clear that the part of the nazi law that was added by the nazi regime is only a small part of that law registration of guns for instance was begun in and thus not a nazi inspired idea the parts of the nazi law that parallel the gca include handgun control of some sort and the identification of certain weapons as sporting weapons the jpfo then goes on to list other parts of the nazi law forbidding ownership of weapons by jews of course there are no such provisions in the american gca nevertheless in a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters immediately after the discussion of the anti jewish parts of the law the jpfo article continues given the parallels between the nazi weapons law and the gca so as to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law don porges porges inmet camb inmet com uunet inmet porges

donald l nash writes in article r f bp transfer stratus com cdt sw stratus com c d tavares writes no you were right the first time law enforcement agencies should keep his opinions in mind before breaking into or assaulting anybody s house ok let me correct my unfortunate choice of words i just hope that the law enforcement agencies keep your attitude in mind the next time your wife is gang raped by a bunch of juvenile drug dealing thugs while she was jogging in the park no strike that etc the batf came out with horse trailers men ninja uniforms machine guns and stun grenades and used them before koresh could even look at the warrant koresh fought back and people died the key part of this sentense is koresh fought back this was his big mistake when the police decide to exert their authority over you you don t fight back unless you want people to get hurt you cease all resistance and signal your submission to their authority the cops they are the boss you are the subject the concept of defense against illegal action under color of law is kaput no longer is it government of the people by the people its government of the people by the biggest guns the idea of sorting it out in court later is fine but one has to get to court in one piece to do that korash had good reason to think that he was not going to get that chance see below aren t in it to beat up and kill people in spite of the actions of a few bad apples if you quit resisting they quit hitting perhaps the batf did over react to the threat posed by koresh perhaps they did use too much force ok fine i m willing to concede to that point if sufficient proof is produced and i admit that there is some evidence to indicate this however resisting the batf is the worst thing koresh could have done if they hadn t resisted there is a good chance that no one would have been hurt remeber they were using stun grenades not anti personnel grenades if the bds were not in violation of any rember korash didn t get to sort this all out serenely typing at his keyboard he heard some kind of explosives go off he saw he was being attacked with no overt action from him yet he could no more say oh its ok its only stun grenades anymore than i could he slammed the door at that point and proceeded to repel the attackers he felt in genuine fear of his life i know i would be in fear of my life at that point have you ever been shot at how clear and logically could you think under that pressure when you might have all of or seconds to evaluate what is going on and it would not be the first time that law enforcements intended to bring in their suspect horizontally for all we know he was informed by someone saying something like hey guy the batf is coming like gangbusters and they mean to waste you according to the latest news the released warrant so we are told said the reason for this ww iii raid was that korash s group had spent around on firearms and related stuff over an undetermined period now even assuming that the figure isn t calculated like the feds do a drug siezure for people that isn t really all that much you priced decent guns lately hell i can think of a person right now that probably has that much for one individual mostly machineguns sure he is an avid collector but unless a new law has been passed it is not illegal nor an indication of anything illegal to have a lot of guns also note that the warrant had nothing to say about machine guns so what is the justification of this cowboy raid other than a romp gone bad for some anti gun media hype to support clinton s push for disarming the unconnected citizen of any and all effective defensive weapons this administration has only one thing in mind control people control whether it is gun control clinton cripple chip national smart id cards it all boils down to people control can you say only years late i knew you could laws they would have been released as they had been before if this had happened and it turned out that the batf had used too much force then the bds would have grounds for a law suit and for federal charges of civil rights violations sounds a lot like la huh don t take that wrong i m not commenting one way or the other about the rodney king case but that s not what they wanted they got tipped off that the batf was on the way in and rather than adopting a non violent non threatening posture to greet the batf they decided to fight and batf knew the bds were expecting them via minutes report but they decided they were so big so bad they would have a cakewalk at the bds expense for a nice media show anyway but it all turned to shit and the fbi taking over to manage things we see it all turned to shit too clinton says i am taking full responsibility bah responsibility means to take the repercussions if it goes wrong bet you nobody pays any serious repercussions responsibility only has meaning as media pr or as a means to corner the average joe schmoe figure it out clinton reno the fbi and batf will all be immune can you say whitewash i ve said enough of this issue i m probably not going to convince any of you folks and you re certainly not going to convince me i ve got

1659###talk.politics.guns###analysis of second amendment was re some more about gun control in article apr ra msstate edu dnewcomb whale st usm edu donald r newcomb writes first i would like to say how much i appreciate having so literate and erudite an individual as mr rutledge with whom to discuss this topic frankly most anti rkba posters refuse even to approach the topic of the original understanding of the bill of rights as detailed in the writings of the era this is most refreshing second i must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days my brigade s quarterly drill was this weekend and i needed to attend to several matters pertaining to the state militia some people seem to feel that the concept of the militia is an anachro nism that is out of place in the th century i m not sure the swiss would agree and i think perhaps a discussion of how the militia both organized and unorganized fits into the defense plans of my state mississippi please do not assume that this describes something peculiar to one southern state for instance the commonwealth of massachusetts has a well organized militia which members report maintains stocks of both riot guns and machine guns the laws of other states will vary but are probably similar it appears it is time that this article originally posted by larry cipriani last year and which i saved gets posted again it offers as good an analysis of the meaning of the second amendment especially regarding the militia clause as i have seen i have not seen any rebuttles with similar bone fides enjoy flames to dev null begin enclosed article the unabridged second amendment by j neil schulman if you wanted to know all about the big bang you d ring up carl sagan right and if you wanted to know about desert warfare the man to call would be norman schwarzkopf no question about it but who would you call if you wanted the top expert on american usage to tell you the meaning of the second amendment to the united states constitution that was the question i asked a c brocki editorial coordinator of the los angeles unified school district and formerly senior editor at houghton mifflin publishers who himself had been recommended to me as the foremost expert on english usage in the los angeles school system mr brocki told me to get in touch with roy copperud a retired professor journalism at the university of southern california and the author of american usage and style the consensus a little research lent support to brocki s opinion of professor copperud s expertise roy copperud was a newspaper writer on major dailies for over three decades before embarking on a a distinguished year career teaching journalism at usc since copperud has been writing a column dealing with the professional aspects of journalism for editor and publisher a weekly magazine focusing on the journalism field he s on the usage panel of the american heritage dictionary and merriam webster s usage dictionary frequently cites him as an expert copperud s fifth book on usage american usage and style the consensus has been in continuous print from van nostrand reinhold since and is the winner of the association of american publisher s humanities award that sounds like an expert to me after a brief telephone call to professor copperud in which i introduced myself but did not give him any indication of why i was interested i sent the following letter i am writing you to ask you for your professional opinion as an expert in english usage to analyze the text of the second amendment to the united states constitution and extract the intent from the text the text of the second amendment is a well regulated militia being necessary for the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed the debate over this amendment has been whether the first part of the sentence a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state is a restrictive clause or a subordinate clause with respect to the independent clause containing the subject of the sentence the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed i would request that your analysis of this sentence not take into consideration issues of political impact or public policy but be restricted entirely to a linguistic analysis of its meaning and intent further since your professional analysis will likely become part of litigation regarding the consequences of the second amendment i ask that whatever analysis you make be a professional opinion that you would be willing to stand behind with your reputation and even be willing to testify under oath to support if necessary my letter framed several questions about the test of the second amendment then concluded i realize that i am asking you to take on a major responsibility and task with this letter i am doing so because as a citizen i believe it is vitally important to extract the actual meaning of the second amendment while i ask that your analysis not be affected by the political importance of its results i ask that you do this because of that importance after several more letters and phone calls in which we discussed terms for his doing such an analysis but in which we never discussed either of our opinions regarding the second amendment gun control or any other political subject professor copperud sent me the follow analysis into which i have inserted my questions for the sake of clarity copperud the words a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state contrary to the interpretation cited in your letter of july constitutes a present participle rather than a clause it is used as an adjective modifying militia which is followed by the main clause of the sentence subject the right verb shall the to keep and bear arms is asserted as an essential for maintaining a militia in reply to your numbered questions schulman can the sentence be interpreted to grant the right to keep and bear arms solely to a well regulated militia copperud the sentence does not restrict the right to keep and bear arms nor does it state or imply possession of the right elsewhere or by others than the people it simply makes a positive statement with respect to a right of the people schulman is the right of the people to keep and bear arms granted by the words of the second amendment or does the second amendment assume a preexisting right of the people to keep and bear arms and merely state that such right shall not be infringed copperud the right is not granted by the amendment its existence is assumed the thrust of the sentence is that the right shall be preserved inviolate for the sake of ensuring a militia schulman is the right of the people to keep and bear arms conditioned upon whether or not a well regulated militia is in fact necessary to the security of a free state and if that condition is not existing is the statement the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed null and void copperud no such condition is expressed or implied the right to keep and bear arms is not said by the amendment to depend on the existence of a militia no condition is stated or implied as to the relation of the right to keep and bear arms and to the necessity of a well regulated militia as a requisite to the security of a free state the right to keep and bear arms is deemed unconditional by the entire sentence schulman does the clause a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state grant a right to the government to place conditions on the right of the people to keep and bear arms or is such right deemed unconditional by the meaning of the entire sentence copperud the right is assumed to exist and to be unconditional as previously stated it is invoked here specifically for the sake of the militia schulman which of the following does the phrase well regulated militia mean well equipped well organized well drilled well educated or subject to regulations of a superior authority copperud the phrase means subject to regulations of a superior authority this accords with the desire of the writers for civilian control over the military schulman if at all possible i would ask you to take account the changed meanings of words or usage since that sentence was written years ago but not take into account historical interpretations of the intents of the authors unless those issues can be clearly separated copperud to the best of my knowledge there has been no change in the meaning of words or in usage that would affect the meaning of the amendment if it were written today it might be put since a well regulated militia is necessary tot he security of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be abridged schulman as a scientific control on this analysis i would also appreciate it if you could compare your analysis of the text of the second amendment to the following sentence a well schooled electorate being necessary to the security of a free state the right of the people to keep and read books shall not be infringed my questions for the usage analysis of this sentence would be is the grammatical structure and usage of this sentence and the way the words modify each other identical to the second amendment s sentence and could this sentence be interpreted to restrict the right of the people to keep and read books only to a well educated electorate for example registered voters with a high school diploma copperud your scientific control sentence precisely parallels the amendment in grammatical structure there is nothing in your sentence that either indicates or implies the possibility of a restricted interpretation professor copperud had only one additional comment which he placed in his cover letter with well known human curiosity i made some speculative efforts to decide how the material might be used but was unable to reach any conclusion so now we have been told by one of the top experts on american usage what many knew all along the constitution of the united states unconditionally protects the people s right to keep and bear arms forbidding all governments formed under the constitution from abridging that right as i write this the attempted coup against constitutional government in the soviet union has failed apparently because the will of the people in that part of the world to be free from capricious tyranny is stronger than the old guard s desire to maintain a monopoly on dictatorial power and here in the united states elected lawmakers judges and appointed officials who are pledged to defend the constitution of the united states ignore marginalize or prevaricate about the second amendment routinely american citizens are put in american prisons for carrying arms owning arms of forbidden sorts or failing to satisfy bureaucratic requirements regarding the owning and carrying of firearms all of which is an abridgement of the unconditional right of the people to keep and bear arms guaranteed by the constitution and even the american civil liberties union aclu staunch defender of the rest of the bill of rights stands by and does nothing it seems it is up to those who believe in the right to keep and bear arms to preserve that right no one else will no one else can will we beg our elected representatives not to take away our rights and continue regarding them as representing us if they do will we continue obeying judges who decide that the second amendment doesn t mean what it says it means but means whatever they say it means in their orwellian doublespeak or will be simply keep and bear the arms of our choice as the constitution of the united states promises us we can and

rutledge wrote in article q tpinnpcn gap caltech edu arc cco caltech edu aaron ray clements writes the second amendment is a guarantee of the right to bear arms clearly and unequivocally without infringement unfortunately the second amendment is not as clear as you state if last part of it is taken along it follows what you have said the problem i have is with the first part of the single sentence which makes up the amendment the second amendment is a well regulated militia being necessary to the security militia of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear state arms shall not be infringed arms you didn t even get the capitalization correct try reading usca on the constitution or get any other correct version of the constitution this mention of a well regulated militia is what confuses me according to the federalist paper s a well regulated militia has a well defined structure and follows nationally uniform regulations perhaps you should actually read the federalist papers james madison federalist paper besides the advantage of being armed which the americans possess over the people of almost every other nation the existence of subordinate governments to which the people are attached and by which the militia officers are appointed forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of europe which are carried as far as the public resources will bear the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms james madison i annals of congress june the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed a well regulated militia composed of the body of the people trained to arms is the best and most natural defense of a free country alexander hamilton federalist paper on the organization of the militia little more can reasonably be aimed at with respect to the people at large than to have them properly armed and equipped and in order to see that this be not neglected it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year alexander hamilton federalist paper speaking of standing armies if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens little if at all inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow citizens but surely hamilton and madison didn t mean the people when they said people right that s why the amendment refers to the right of the militia your average year old male does not fall into the definition you re right the militia consists of all able bodied males and probably females under current interpretation therefore most members of the militia the one the every gun advocate refers to are not members of a well organized militia and therefore are not directly the amendment does nor refer to well organized it says well regulated i have some targets you may examine if you wish to check how well regulated i am mentioned in the amendment if this amendment wanted to allow every member of the militia to keep and bear arms why did it specificly mention a well organized militia in the same sentence as the right to keep and bear arms correct that s why the right is reserved to the people and that was to insure the people could form a well regulated militia not a well organized militia it could be argued that the first part of the sentence is separate from the last part if so why was it include in the same atomic unit of written what do atomic units have to do with this argument any moron can set h bar c instead of a separate sentence oh i see what your question is why don t you read the federalist papers james madison federalist paper regarding the general welfare clause nothing is more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars but what does madison know about the grammatical style of the nd he only wrote it the amendment also implies that the right to arms has to due with the security of a free state the federalist paper s mention of a well regulated militia gives many examples of how this militia protects the security of a free state all these examples are actions of a very organized force not some john q public with a gun that s obviously because you ve never actually read the federalist papers all that the second amendment clearly states to me is that the people s right to form well regulated militias shall not be infringed that is people have the right to join a well organized militia this well organized militia will of course provide training in how to use arms and in basic military tactics these training members of the militia can keep and bear the arms can t read huh show me where the document says well organized militia lastly reading through the federalist paper s on well organized militia it is very clear that many of the reasons for these militias one reason stated is the protection from a standing army these days the standing army could easily defeat a group consisting of every year old male and female not in the armied forces that is exactly why every person should be allowed to own any weapon currently in use in the armed forces another reason stated for well organized militias is to reduced the need for a standing army well the us armied forces have been a standing army for more than half the history of the us but the major reason is to protect against that very same army it seems to me the whole reason for the second amendment to give the people protection from the us government by guaranteeing that the people can over through the government if necessary is a little bit of an anachronism is this day and age maybe its time to re think how this should be done and amend the constitution appropriately abraham lincoln first inaugural address march this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it rep elbridge gerry of massachusetts spoken during floor debate over the second amendment i annals of congress at august what sir is the use of a militia it is to prevent the establishment of a standing army the bane of liberty whenever governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of the people they always attempt to destroy the militia in order to raise an army upon their ruins so now we know which category mr rutledge is in he means to destroy our liberties and rights charles scripter cescript phy mtu edu dept of physics michigan tech houghton mi when all government in little as in great things shall be drawn to washington as the centre of all power it will render powerless the checks provided of one government on another and will become as venal and oppressive as the government from which we separated thomas jefferson in article q tpinnpcn gap caltech edu arc cco caltech edu aaron ray clements writes the second amendment is a guarantee of the right to bear arms clearly and unequivocally without infringement unfortunately the second amendment is not as clear as you state if last part of it is taken along it follows what you have said the problem i have is with the first part of the single sentence which makes up the amendment the second amendment is a well regulated militia being necessary to the security militia of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear state arms shall not be infringed arms you didn t even get the capitalization correct try reading usca on the constitution or get any other correct version of the constitution there are several ways in which one can choose to intrepret any constitutational issue a original intent b subjectively intrepreted accordiong to political whims of the day if we use original intent as the basis for intrepreting the constitution it is clear that the founding fathers intended that the individual citizen be allowed to bear arms similar to those used by soldiers of the day for references i cite federalist papers the embarassing second ammendment

specify your correct e mail address to reply to what is jpeg jpeg pronounced jay peg is a standardized image compression mechanism jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard jpeg is designed for compressing either full color or gray scale digital images of natural real world scenes it does not work so well on non realistic images such as cartoons or line drawings jpeg does not handle black and white bit per pixel images nor does it handle motion picture compression standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees named jbig and mpeg respectively jpeg is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn t quite identical to what you originally put in the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details aren t perceived as well as small details of light and dark thus jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans if you plan to machine analyze your images the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality you can make extremely small files if you don t mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc conversely if you aren t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression why use jpeg there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store bit per pixel color data instead of bit per pixel data making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images being able to compress a mbyte full color file down to kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time if you are comparing gif and jpeg the size ratio is more like four to one more details below if your viewing software doesn t support jpeg directly you ll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images even with a jpeg capable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance thus using jpeg is essentially a time space tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply it s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file i ll let you do the arithmetic yourself the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information bits pixel million colors instead of or less or fewer colors if you have only bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you within a couple of years though bit gif will look as obsolete as black and white macpaint format does today furthermore for reasons detailed in section jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif jpeg is not going to displace gif entirely for some types of images gif is superior in image quality file size or both one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to as a rule of thumb jpeg is superior to gif for storing full color or gray scale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and similar material jpeg is superior even if you don t have bit display hardware and it is a lot superior if you do see section for details gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings in particular large areas of pixels that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif jpeg can t squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects this sort of image is best kept in gif form in particular single color borders are quite cheap in gif files but they should be avoided in jpeg files jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pure black pixels adjacent to a row of pure white pixels for example sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in gif files borders overlaid text etc the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that s only a few pixels high if you have a gif with a lot of small size overlaid text don t jpeg it computer drawn images ray traced scenes for instance usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity the more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same goes for semi realistic artwork fantasy drawings and such plain black and white two level images should never be converted to jpeg you need at least about gray levels before jpeg is useful for gray scale images it should also be noted that gif is lossless for gray scale images of up to levels while jpeg is not if you have an existing library of gif images you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg you will lose a little image quality if you do section which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif only applies if both formats start from a full color original if you start from a gif you ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information jpeg can only make things worse however the disk space savings may justify converting anyway this is a decision you ll have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section for hints be prepared to leave some images in gif format since some gifs will not convert well how well does jpeg compress images pretty darn well here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy a x full color image of a ship in a harbor the first three files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section b file size in bytes comments ship ppm original file in ppm format no compression bits or bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead ship ppm z ppm file passed through unix compress compress doesn t accomplish a lot you ll note other text oriented compressors give similar results ship gif converted to gif with ppmquant fs ppmtogif most of the savings is the result of losing color info gif saves bits pixel not see sec ship jpg cjpeg q highest useful quality setting this is indistinguishable from the bit original at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs ship jpg cjpeg q default setting you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original even with both on screen at once ship jpg cjpeg q this has slight defects if you know what to look for you could tell it s been jpeged without seeing the original still as good image quality as many recent postings in usenet pictures groups ship jpg cjpeg q jpeg s characteristic blockiness becomes apparent at this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some still i ve seen plenty of usenet postings that were of poorer image quality than this ship jpg o cjpeg q optimize optimize cuts table overhead blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or indexing purposes note that this file is tiny the compression ratio from the original is in this case jpeg can make a file that s a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality the q file is every bit as good as the gif better if you have a full color display this seems to be a typical ratio for real world scenes what are good quality settings for jpeg most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings quality does not mean keep of the information as some have claimed the quality scale is purely arbitrary it s not a percentage of anything the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb the default quality setting q is very often the best choice this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image try q first if you see defects then go up except for experimental purposes never go above q saying q will produce a file two or three times as large as q but of hardly any better quality if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to q without objectionable degradation on the other hand you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg the default q is about right for compressing bit images but q to is usually better for converting gifs see section for more info if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are prepared to tolerate large defects a q setting in the range of to is about right q or so may be amusing as op art note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section b and to many programs based on it other jpeg implementations such as image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale some programs don t even provide a numeric scale just high medium low style choices where can i get jpeg software most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp if you don t know how to use ftp see the faq article how to find sources if you don t have direct access to ftp read about ftpmail servers in

jpeg faq from the news answers archive a if you are looking for canned software viewers etc the first part of this list is system specific programs that only run on one kind of system if you don t see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet but some commercial programs are listed too x windows xv shareware is an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and many other image formats it can also do format conversion and some simple image manipulations it s available for ftp from export lcs mit edu file contrib xv tar z version is a major upgrade with support for bit displays and many other improvements however it is brand new and still has some bugs lurking if you prefer not to be on the bleeding edge stick with version also available from export note that version is not a good choice if you have a bit display you ll get only bit color nor for converting bit images to jpeg but works fine for converting gif and other bit images to jpeg caution there is a glitch in version be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a jpeg file or the file will be blurry another good choice for x windows is john cristy s free imagemagick package also available from export lcs mit edu file contrib imagemagick tar z this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks the imagemagick viewer handles bit displays correctly for colormapped displays it does better though slower color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software both of the above are large complex packages if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release xloadimage is free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib xloadimage tar z xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg files because it has the ijg v decoder while xloadimage is using a hacked over v the next xloadimage release will fix this xli is also free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib xli tar z both programs are said to do the right thing with bit displays ms dos this covers plain dos for windows or os programs see the next headings one good choice is eric praetzel s free dvpeg which views jpeg and gif files the current version is available by ftp from sunee uwaterloo ca file pub jpeg viewers dvpeg zip this is a good basic viewer that works on either or machines the user interface is not flashy but it s functional another freeware jpeg gif tga viewer is mohammad rezaei s hiview the current version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics hv zip hiview requires a or better cpu and a vcpi compatible memory manager qemm and max work windows and os do not hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen for larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen rather than using panning scrolling as most viewers do you may or may not prefer this approach but there s no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably note installation is a bit tricky read the directions carefully a shareware alternative is colorview for dos this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives its user interface is also much spiffier looking although personally i find it harder to use more keystrokes inconsistent behavior it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview at least on my hardware for images larger than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than hiview the current version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics dcview zip requires a vesa graphics driver if you don t have one look in vesadrv zip or vesa tsr zip from the same directory many recent pcs have a built in vesa driver so don t try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing a second shareware alternative is fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but i don t know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel archives at that time the well known gif viewer compushow cshow supports jpeg in its latest revision a however cshow s jpeg implementation isn t very good it s slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is poor except on hi color displays too bad it d have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow shareware available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos gif cshw a zip due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine if you can t get any of them to work you ll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif then view with your favorite gif viewer if you have hi color hardware don t use gif as the intermediate format try to find a targa capable viewer instead vpic is reputed to do the right thing with hi color

from ftp rahul net file pub bryanw pc jpeg wecj zip requires windows and or more colors mode this is a no frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers but it s so fast you ll use it anyway at least for previewing jview is freeware fairly fast has good on line help and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format but it can t create new jpeg files and it doesn t view gifs jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but it s an excellent basic viewer the current version is available from ftp cica indiana edu file pub pc win desktop jview zip mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites including wuarchive wustl edu winjpeg shareware displays jpeg gif targa tiff and bmp image files it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter it has some other nifty features including color balance adjustment and slideshow the current version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note above file msdos windows winjp zip this is a slow compatible version if you register you ll get the only version which is roughly faster colorview is another shareware entry this was an early and promising contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it has no real advantages over winjpeg if you want to try it anyway the current version is available from ftp cica indiana edu file pub pc win desktop cview zip i understand that a new version will be

macintosh most mac jpeg programs rely on apple s jpeg implementation which is part of the quicktime system extension so you need to have quicktime installed to use quicktime you need a or better cpu and you need to be running system or later if you re running system you must also install the bit quickdraw extension this is built in on system you can get quicktime by ftp from ftp apple com file dts mac quicktime quicktime hqx as of this file contains quicktime which is better than qt in several ways with respect to jpeg it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file however some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt mac users should keep in mind that quicktime s jpeg format pict jpeg is not the same as the usenet standard jfif jpeg format see section for details if you post images on usenet make sure they are in jfif format most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format the first choice is probably jpegview a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format pict jpeg format or gif format it also can convert between the two jpeg formats the current version is a big improvement over prior versions get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app jpeg view hqx requires system and quicktime on bit displays jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers in fact it s the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over x pixels on a typical mb mac given a large image jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers you can zoom in on any desired portion though some people like this behavior some don t overall jpegview s user interface is very well thought out gifconverter a shareware image viewer converter supports jfif and pict jpeg as well as gif and several other image formats the latest version is get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac art gif gif converter hqx requires system or later gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeg gif viewer but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images also the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images without quicktime so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime but it s faster with quicktime note if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert then viewing the gif version jpeg convert a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities is available from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app jpeg convert hqx this will run on any mac but it only does file conversion not viewing you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v a jpeg gif converter based on an old version of the ijg code if you are using this program you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert apple s free program pictpixie can view images in jfif quicktime jpeg and gif format and can convert between these formats you can get pictpixie from ftp apple com file dts mac quicktime qt stuff pictpixie hqx requires quicktime pictpixie was intended as a developer s tool and it s really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface worse pictpixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix there is an old version of pictpixie called pictcompressor floating around the net if you have this you should trash it as it s even buggier also the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleaned up descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net storm technology s picture decompress is a free jpeg viewer converter this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without system or quicktime so you may be forced to use it on older systems it does need bit quickdraw so really old machines can t use it you can get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app picture decompress hqx you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to jpeg to allow picture decompress to open it if your machine is too old to run bit quickdraw a mac plus for instance gifconverter is your only choice for single program jpeg viewing if you don t want to pay for gifconverter use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg although not all can deal with the usenet standard jfif

a viewer program if your display is bits or less any gif viewer will do fine if you have a display with more color capability try to find a viewer that can read targa or ppm bit image files there are numerous commercial jpeg offerings with more popping up every day i recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow in that

for details we hope to make this software industrial quality although as with anything that s free we offer no warranty and accept no liability the independent jpeg group is a volunteer organization if you d like to contribute to improving our software you are welcome to join what s all this hoopla about color quantization most people don t have full color bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware stores or fewer bits per pixel so it can display or fewer distinct colors at a time to display a full color image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors this process is called color quantization this is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term we re stuck with the standard usage though clearly color quantization is a lossy process it turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings since jpeg is a full color format converting a color jpeg image for display on bit or less hardware requires color quantization this is true for all color jpegs even if you feed a or less color gif into jpeg what comes out of the decompressor is not colors but thousands of colors this happens because jpeg s lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray scale output incidentally because of this effect it s nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences i occasionally see posted images described as color jpeg this tells me that the poster a hasn t read this faq and b probably converted the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classified as color or gray scale just like photographs but number of colors just isn t a useful concept for jpeg on the other hand a gif image by definition has already been quantized to or fewer colors a gif does have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format doesn t allow more than palette entries for purposes of usenet picture distribution gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients don t have to this is also the disadvantage of gif you re stuck with the sender s quantization if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to re quantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full color image furthermore if the sender didn t use a high quality color quantization algorithm you re out of luck for this reason jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don t match the sender s display hardware jpeg s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user s display hardware furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of jpeg images you already have with a gif you re stuck forevermore with what was sent it s also worth mentioning that many gif viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines if you view a color gif on a color ega display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations one to create the gif one to display it but often it s also due to sloppiness jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed thus jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for low color resolution displays as well as high resolution ones finally an ever growing number of people have better than bit display hardware already bit hi color pc displays true bit displays on workstations and macintoshes etc for these people gif is already obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively thus jpeg is an all around better choice than gif for representing images in a machine independent fashion how does jpeg work the buzz words to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding this article s long enough already so i m not going to say more than that here for technical information see the comp compression faq this is available from the news answers archive at rtfm mit edu in files pub usenet news answers compression faq part if you need help in using the news answers archive see the top of this article what about lossless jpeg there s a great deal of confusion on this subject the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm i e one that guarantees the final output is bit for bit identical to the original input however this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offers much less compression at present very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist and all of them are commercial saying q to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step with the v free jpeg code you can also say sample x to turn off subsampling keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value it s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image at this minimum loss setting regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed bit per pixel image true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bit for bit accuracy if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with or more bits per pixel furthermore jpeg is public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents why all the argument about file formats strictly speaking jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms it does not refer to a specific image file format the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations since we can t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem in the absence of official standards a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs aren t compatible with anybody else s the closest thing we have to a de facto standard jpeg format is some work that s been coordinated by people at c cube microsystems they have defined two jpeg based file formats jfif jpeg file interchange format a low end format that transports pixels and not much else tiff jpeg aka tiff an extension of the aldus tiff format tiff is a high end format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides tiff is a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets of tiff it s not likely that adding jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpeg related products it s reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the tiff spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details even when tiff jpeg is well defined the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator tiff jpeg files may never be as transportable a particular case that people may be interested in is apple s quicktime software for the macintosh quicktime uses a jfif compatible format wrapped inside the mac specific pict structure conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward and several mac programs are available to do it see mac portion of section a if you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section for details another particular case is handmade software s programs gif jpg jpg gif and image alchemy these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi this format is not readable by any non hsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings use the j switch to get jfif output this applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif format by default you still should be careful not to post hsi format files unless you want to get flamed by people on non pc platforms how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software won t read it s likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg based format you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file a jfif standard file will start with the characters hex ff d ff e followed by two variable bytes often hex followed by jfif if you see ff d at the start but not the rest of it you may have a raw jpeg file this is probably decodable as is by jfif software it s worth a try anyway hsi files start with hsi you re out of luck unless you have hsi software portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they won t decompress properly with non hsi programs a macintosh pict file if jpeg compressed will have a couple hundred bytes of header followed by a jfif header scan for jfif strip off everything before the ff d and you should be able to read it anything else it s a proprietary format or not jpeg at all if you are lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d try stripping off everything before that in uuencoded usenet postings the characteristic jfif pattern is begin line m c x whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with begin line m i if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non jfif files what about arithmetic coding the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed the choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file on typical images arithmetic coding produces a file or percent smaller than huffman coding all the file size numbers previously cited are for huffman coding unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm at t and mitsubishi thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses from these companies the fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best at least in the short run i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding the space savings isn t great enough to justify the potential legal hassles in particular arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future stay tuned for further details does loss accumulate with repeated compression decompression it would be nice if having compressed an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially unfortunately this is not the case in general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without changing it then there is no further loss i e you get an identical jpeg file even this is not true at least not with the current free jpeg software it s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first generation output it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change one of the things on our to do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but i am not optimistic about it in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full color output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff error degradation if you re wondering why it s because the pixel block boundaries move if you cropped off only multiples of pixels you might be safe but that s a mighty limited capability the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you don t want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while working on the image then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compression decompression time this way what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg as stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg if you can obtain the original full color data the gif was made from it s far better to make a jpeg from that but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding gif that will give you a chance to re do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary some gifs may be better left as gifs as explained in section in particular cartoon type gifs with sixteen or fewer colors don t convert well you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be larger than the gif so check the sizes too experience to date suggests that large high visual quality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to jpeg with least degradation don t waste your time converting any gif much under kbytes also don t expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from full color originals to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight through jpeg files would be i e shoot for or rd the size of the gif file not th as suggested in earlier comparisons many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant color border around a gif image while useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files it is not free in jpeg files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging if you are on an x windows system xv s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this cjpeg s default q setting of is appropriate for full color input but for gif inputs q settings of to often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation if you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher q setting may not be necessary color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the colors that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value the trouble with dithering is that to jpeg it looks like high spatial frequency color noise and jpeg can t compress noise very well the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you had it to get around this you want to smooth the gif image before compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a better looking output image than you d get without smoothing with the v free jpeg software or products based on it a simple smoothing capability is built in try smooth or so when converting gifs values of to seem to work well for high quality gifs heavy handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors if you can see regular fine scale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you don t want if you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package however cjpeg s built in smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol the upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality smooth is probably a good starting point for converting gifs but if you really care about the image you ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings for more information about jpeg in general or the free

2489###comp.graphics###advice sought turning font outlines into renderable polygons i am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a postscript type or truetype font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted by a d scanline renderer i have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but have never had the need to implement such a system well i now have the opportunity to write some font rendering software so i would like to have some of my questions answered before i jump into the deep end the main problem i face is how to use the even odd or non winding rules to turn the outlines into a single outline polygon my renderer can handle complex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple polygons for example in the letter o there are two outlines the outside outline which is clockwise truetype font the inside outline which is counterclockwise one common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the two outlines are closest this is equivalent to descibing a polygon with holes the renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior polygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges i do not want to use this simplistic system since it will not handle all outline fonts properly it is not a simple matter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for some fancy fonts it does not properly handle the even odd or non winding rules from my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid decomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids as is done by the postscript and truetype font rasterizers these trapezoidal polygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the d scanline renderer my question is are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into polgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer i am not fond of this solution since it creates excess number of polygons another question for those in the know what is the best algorithm to create bevelled and or offset curves for font outlines i have a dozen papers on these subjects but i can t tell which method is the best to implement thanks for any pointers rob lansdale robert lansdale dynamic graphics project internet lansd dgp toronto edu computer systems research institute uucp uunet dgp toronto edu lansd university of toronto bitnet lansd dgp utoronto toronto ontario m s a canada

237###comp.graphics###full color image editor for sgi workstations i am happy to announce the first public release of the bit program an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on sgi gl besides typical touchup tasks such as crop rotate smooth etc bit offers some unique features not available in similar programs such as text and vector support and the separation of text and image the following is the relevant sections from the man page pre release of may bit l name bit bitmap image touchup for sgi workstations description bit is an interactive full color image viewer and editor based on silicon graphics gl as a full color program bit handles images of both bits and color index in a natural and efficient manner as an image viewer bit allows list of images to be displayed in their original type bits or color index in any order and in any of the many built in styles of display you can walk up and down the list using mouse and keyboard or you can let bit do the walk for you the slideshow with the pan and zoom features large images can be viewed in full without being limited by the window or screen size as an image editor bit performs a large number of image editing and processing tasks accurately and efficiently it keeps information loss at any stage of the editing process at an absolute minimum by performing subpixel sampling automatically while conserving the input image type whenever possible to avoid unnecessary promotion and or quantization of input images you can also cut a piece of an image and paste it into another in addition arbitrarily colored and sized text and simple geometric figures can be rendered on top of an image for annotation with the option to make them part of the bitmap or output separately to take advantage of the higher printer resolutions e g postscript bit can also be used as a graphical user interface to many existing image processing programs by defining external bindings which in essence turn command line oriented programs into bit subfunctions and can be accessed by a press of a button and best of all the processed image will be read back and displayed immediately convolution using exter nally defined matrices of arbitrary order can be performed dynamically giving great flexibility in processing an image features bit performs all of its image manipulations interactively with a continuous progress report and once the processing is complete the processed image will be displayed current features include o rotates an image by an arbitrary angle with the option of anti aliasing and filling the rotated out region with an arbitrary color o scales an image by arbitrary factors in x and or y directions with the option of subpixel sampling o renders text of arbitrary color size or orientation on top of an image with the option of rendering directly into the raster or saving the text and raster separately such as into a postscript file to take advantage of a higher printer resolution besides normal text strings many predefined special symbols can be input conveniently as in tex e g alpha small beta produces greek alphabet alpha followed by a slightly smaller greek alphabet beta o presents graphically the histogram of an image o performs arbitrary to pixel transformation the transformation function can be specified interactively and can be of arbitrary forms further the transformation can be applied to rgb channels separately or simultaneously and to the entire image or a portion of it many difficult tasks such as thresholding can be accomplished rather easily by to transformation in combination with the avai lability of graphical histograms of the image o places simple geometric figures sgfs e g arrows circles trian gles etc of arbitrary color size and orientation into an image at arbitrary locations addressed either in absolute pixels or in some user definable coordinate system units with the option of rendering directly into the raster or save the sgfs and raster separately e g postscript file all sgfs can be scaled in x and y directions independently or simultaneously this is how to get an ellipse from a circle o performs edge detection in combination with image histograms and to transformation very accurate result can be obtained o performs histogram equalization o performs convolution with externally defined square matrices of arbitrary order o crops a rectangular portion of an image o cuts and pastes across images o magnifies any portion of an image by any amount o displays a list of images in sequence with a user specifiable pause interval between images slideshow o measures rgb intensities of a pixel at any location or all pixels along an arbitrary line with the result presented as rgb intensities or as an intensity vs distance plot o performs image type conversions o converts image formats o smoothes an image special convolution o filters an image by external programs and read the filtered image back and display it o modify an individual pixel s rgb values o performs fft on the entire image or a portion of it and display the resulting power spectra o spray and brush paint in full color unavailable in this pre release supported formats o iris rgb native to sgi iris o jpeg jfif format o compuserv gif o pnm portable any map including ppm pgm and pbm o xbm x window bitmap o tiff o postscript write only hardware requirements any sgi workstation that supports rgbmode including indigoes where to get it anonymous ftp to monte svec uh edu pub bit bitxxx tar z where xxx is the version number current version is read src readme for installation instructions after unpacking acknowledgement jpeg support is based on the independent jpeg groups s library version forms library developed by mark overmars is used for gui both jpeg and forms library are included in this release bit is the program you will ever need to view and annotate images the built in editing features will satisfy most of your editing needs in addition the external filter and dynamical kernel will utilize any program you already have so try it and you will like it as always any comments bug reports are welcome

vmcms csuohio edu writes gun buyback programs will hopefully have an impact on accidental shootings especially youths domestic disputes where a gun is available in the heat of emotion and anger and maybe keep a few guns from being stolen and later used in street level crime what gives you the idea that gun buyback programs will have an impact on any of these things evidence please please don t misinterret what i was saying joe i was making the point tha there is no evidence of effect of gun buyback programs but hopefully if there is any effect it may prevent injuries or deaths in one of these types of common incidents saying hopefully the effect of policy x will be y is much different from saying hopefully if there is any effect of policy x it will be y here you ve made both statements if the former describes a reasonably likely outcome of policy x then perhaps policy x is worthy of consideration but the latter statement is not something to base policy decisions on firearms are the fifth leading cause of unintentional deaths among children ages and under according to groups like the center to prevent handgun violence formerly the national coalition to ban handguns interesting name change don t you think who include murder and suicide by firearms in the leading causes of unintentional death figures but don t include murder and suicide by other means as causes of unintentional death can t you see past the bullshit i don t understand how the ratio to other accidental deaths is important so guns don t kill as many children as car accidents what is the difference in severity between deaths and deaths i am not trying to use accidental gun related deaths among children as a justification for gun control who needs to be convinced that accidental gun deaths of children is a serious problem i assumed that any humane person would be concerned when any year old got hold of their parents gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends certainly accidental deaths by any cause are serious things but the anti gun groups insist over and over again that accidental death by firearms is a stastically serious problem and even if you don t use these deaths as a justification for gun control these groups do i m sorry if i jumped to conclusions about your reason for mentioning accidental deaths due to firearms being something that warranted concern but in light of your statement that you are a staunch supporter of gun control measures i think the conclusion was a reasonable one the fact remains that tragic though individual accidental gun deaths may be they are not a serious problem statistically speaking please explain why you think symbolic offerings do good my point was gun buyback programs which are almost always run by police departments might i stress might do a little i stress little good by giving people the impression that the police are attempting to respond to interpersonal gun violence in a unique way overall i thought that i had made it clear that i did not think that gun buyback programs were useful sorry if it wasn t clear to me i thought you were waffling on your view of buyback programs with the talk of symbolic offerings and hopefully preventing accidents and heat of passion shootings i have to disagree on all these counts i can t understand how a buying guns from people who aren t intending to misuse them obviously those who want to use guns to commit crimes aren t going to turn them in could be construed as a positive way for police to respond to interpersonal violence i suggest you go back and look at wherever you saw these statistics i suspect you ll find if you look carefully that is the number of students estimated to have carried a weapon not necessarily a gun to school at least once in the past year and not the number of students who carry a gun to school daily well joe i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence what the people who publish figures saying that as many children commit suicide by handguns alone each year as the fbi says commit suicide by all methods per year who do you think i should believe the people who call everyone up to age children when they re screaming about the carnage of our nation s children being caused by handguns or the centers for disease control ah yes the agency that considers accidental shootings of children to be such a statistical problem that a stated objective in the healthy people document is to enact laws in states requiring manufacturers of handguns to make the handguns more difficult to fire minimizing the likelihood of accidental or intentional dscharge by children the agency that funded the study of dc which pronounced that the dc gun ban had saved x lives yes they actually gave us a number on the basis of a look at the number of shootings rather than the rate of shootings it wasn t their fault that the population of dc dropped in their post law period if you look carefully you will see that you greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths the cphv reports that youth bring guns to school daily and that bring guns to school at least once a year the cdc estimates that out f high school students carried a gun to school at least once in okay i ll concede i no longer have the numbers i once read on these i ll retract my dispute of your numbers however i would be greatly interested in seeing how cphv and cdc came up with these numbers the cdc also says that million elementary aged latch key children kids who come home from school to an empty house have access to guns in their home what s this got to do with anything hell when i was in elementary school i came home to an empty house with guns in it why is this a problem i didn t touch the guns i had been taught not to i had also been taught not to mess with the gasoline in the garage the fuse box the car the knives the oven and the tools the problem is not the guns it s the parents california schools reported a increase in student gun confiscations between and and a increase between and florida reported a percent increase in gun incidents in schools between amd these are the statistics and what are these states doing with the kids they find with guns nothing no criminal prosecution no expulsion in most cases not even suspension they take the gun slap the kids on the wrist say ain t it awful and go on as if everything s back to normal what s wrong with this picture okay maybe i worded it wrong dad i meant that to put children in a situation fortified compound where harm could come to them is not the act of a messiah in my opinion i m not saying that koresh had control over these children directly but i would hope that whatever messiah there is would not let innocent children die i don t think koresh was the messiah either but isn t it obvious that if he believed the forces of evil were come to destroy him then he believed the children were much safer inside the compound i didn t say he was sane just that he behaved in a pretty rational manner given what he thought was going on he thought he had them in the one place where harm wouldn t come to them if as he claimed he was the messiah and people followed him as such why did he not tell their parents to free the children instead of letting them burn alive let s see you try to find the exits unbarricade them and flee a fire when you ve been kept awake for most of days by loudspeakers and subjected to six hours of tanks knocking in your walls and tear gas assault

1927###talk.politics.guns###re gun buy back on thu apr gmt r vmcms csuohio edu wrote firearms are the fifth leading cause of unintentional deaths among children ages and under from the rkba archive rkba total firearm deaths for children through at is one of the smallest causes of deaths in children cars falls burns drowning food ingestion are all much larger cause of deaths so firearms are the th leading cause after drowning and choking on food at least for sorry charles according to the national safety council accident facts in gun accidents were the fifth leading cause of accidental death for children ages and under i don t understand how the ratio to other accidental deaths is important so guns don t kill as many children as car accidents what is the difference in severity between deaths and deaths the difference is that a rational person would address the leading cause first and address the lesser causes later that thinking is so screwed up i don t even know how to respond to it a rational person would concentrate on motor vehicle deaths and not attempt to affect childhood falls drownings gunshot injuries etc so this so called rational person using your definition if he or she were attempting to affect the leading causes of deaths for adults aged through would only worry about cancer and would not try to decrease lesser causes such as heart disease injuries stroke suicide liver disease chronic lung disease homicide hiv infection or diabetes oh okay charles that makes a lot of sense i tell you what charles i ll call the heart foundation and suicide hotlines and tell them that they are not acting rational and that they can all go home because they are addressing the lesser causes of death and you call your local police homicide department liver foundation and diabetes foundation and tell them to stop addressing these lesser causes please quit wasting my time with this silly shit charles i ve got an idea charles why don t you start a talk politics caraccidents group or talk politics fall group this is talk politics guns don t confuse the issue just because a social problem may not claim as many victims as another we should not try to address it i don t agree i m not posting to t p g to debate the supposed severity of causes of childhood deaths i am really getting frigging sick of having to respond to the irrational statements of people who assume that someone who wants to discuss youth gun violence or unintentional youth gun deaths is trying to make a political issue out of it i assumed that any humane person would be concerned when any year old got hold of their parents gun from their bedroom drawer and accidently blew away one of their friends a humane person who keeps a firearm in the house with a year old would also teach this child how to safely handle the firearm ignorance is our greatest enemy again charles you tend to confuse the issue and take things out of context for your own purposes the statement that you responded to above is actually in reference to a previous post by another person who like you expressed concern over making youth gun violence a priority i guess maybe humane person and rational person could be interchangeable huh both would be defined as a person who only addresses the social problem that causes the greatest number of childhood deaths if that is the case i m extremely glad that i am inhumane and irrational well joe i suggest that you talk to the center to prevent handgun violence what other sources of information do you have which confirms their data these folks are well known for misrepresenting the facts perhaps you can verify their data with the uniform crime report sorry charles the fbi uniform crime report is well known for misrepresenting the facts but if you insist according to the ucr firearm murders of youngsters and under increased percent between and is the national center for health statistics good enough for you they state that every day american children ages and under are killed in gun accidents suicides and homicides many more are wounded or how about the national pediatric trauma registry they say gunshot wounds to children ages and under nearly doubled in major urban areas between and do you also doubt the american academy of pediatrics charles they state that gunshot wounds among children in urban areas increased from to charles i hope you don t need to be convinced that youth are increasingly victims of gun injuries and that they have easy access to guns if you don t realize this fact i don t care if you go by cdc or fbi data or if you go into the homes schools and streets where these kids are and take a poll by yourself i m not going to bother to try to convince you its obvious that you have ruled out any idea of discussing this issue in a sane fashion and that you are so focused on trying to make this a gun control and political discussion i really don t want to do that or the centers for disease control they have firearm statistics are firearms a disease charles it s obvious that you know nothing about the cdc they don t just study cancer and heart disease i ve got news for you interpersonal gun violence is an epidemic in surgeon general c everett koop declared that gun violence is as much a public health problem as cancer heart disease or auto accidents that you greatly underestimate the presence of guns in the lives of youths in the lives of youths or in their schools i know a number of youths who have firearms present in their lives is is quite appropriate to teach children to safely handle firearms this is a presence right what are you trying to say this innuendo reminds me of listening to bill clinton who the f k said anything about teaching children to safely handle firearm charles in the future if you are going to post to t p g and jump into a previous discussion please read the entire posting not just sentence that you decide to respond to what the hell are you saying here you re wasting time and space trying to make a political and gun control issue out of a discussion that isn t the cphv reports that youth bring guns to school daily and that bring guns to school at least once a year i wouldn t trust their statistics without independent verification the cdc estimates that out f high school students carried a gun to school at least once in based on cphv statistics based on ucr based on what the cdc also says that million elementary aged latch key children kids who come home from school to an empty house have access to guns in their home therefore what is the purpose of this claim charles buddy i m getting really tired of this do you live on the planet mars as a physicist i realize that you probably don t come into contact with many youth but i really think you need to make a trip to your local urban high school and discover the joy of guns in schools in addition spend a few minutes talking to these kids ask them if they have ever heard gunshots in their neighborhoods whether they know anyone who has been shot whether they know anyone who has a gun whether they have ever held a gun and whether they themselves have ever been shot believe me charles

correction thanks i get regular questions about gamma correction since i go to great pains to deal with it properly in xli the image loader program i maintain here is an explanation i often use to answer these questions this might be suitable for inclusion in the faq graeme gill a note on gamma correction and images author graeme w gill graeme labtam oz au date what is all this gamma stuff anyway although it would be nice to think that an image is an image there are a lot of complications not only are there a whole bunch of different image formats gif jpeg tiff etc etc there is a whole lot of other technical stuff that makes dealing with images a bit complicated gamma is one of those things if you ve ever downloaded images from bbs or the net you ve probably noticed with most image viewing programs that some images look ok some look too dark and some look too light why is this you may ask this is gamma correction or the lack of it why do we need gamma correction at all gamma correction is needed because of the nature of crts cathode ray tubes the monitors usually used for viewing images if you have some sort of real live scene and turn it into a computer image by measuring the amount of light coming from each point of the scene then you have created a linear or un gamma corrected image this is a good thing in many ways because you can manipulate the image as if the values in the image file were light ie adding and multiplying will work just like real light in the real world now if you take the image file and turn each pixel value into a voltage and feed it into a crt you find that the crt doesn t give you an amount of light proportional to the voltage the amount of light coming from the phosphor in the screen depends on the the voltage something like this light out voltage crt gamma so if you just dump your nice linear image out to a crt the image will look much too dark to fix this up you have to gamma correct the image first you need to do the opposite of what the crt will do to the image so that things cancel out and you get what you want so you have to do this to your image gamma corrected image image crt gamma for most crts the crt gamma is somewhere between and if that is all it is why does it seem so complicated the problem is that not all display programs do gamma correction also not all sources of images give you linear images video cameras or video signals in general because of this a lot of images already have some gamma correction done to them and you are rarely sure how much if you try and display one of those images with a program that does gamma correction for you the image gets corrected twice and looks way to light if you display one of those images with a program that doesn t do gamma correction then it will look vaguely right but not perfect because the gamma correction is not exactly right for you particular crt whose fault is all this it is really three things one is all those display programs out there that don t do gamma correction properly another is that most image formats don t specify a standard gamma or don t have some way or recording what their gamma correction is the third thing is that not many people understand what gamma correction is all about and create a lot of images with varying gamma s at least two file formats do the right thing the utah graphics toolkit rle format has a semi standard way of recording the gamma of an image the jfif file standard that uses jpeg compression specifies that the image to be encoded must have a gamma of ie a linear image but not everyone obeys the rules some image loaders for instance xli an x image utility allow you to specify not only the gamma of the monitor you are using but the individual gamma values of image you are trying to view other image viewers eg xv another x image program and utilities eg the pbm toolkit provide ways of changing the gamma of an image but you have to figure out the overall gamma correction yourself allowing for undoing any gamma correction the image has and then the gamma correction you need to suite your crt monitor note that xv doesn t provide an easy way of modifying the gamma of an image you need to adjust the r g and b curves to the appropriate gamma in the coledit controls altering the intensity in the hsv controls doesn t do the right thing as it fails to take account of the effect gamma has on h and s this tends to give a tint to the image how can i figure out what my viewer does or what gamma my screen has the simplest way to do that is to try loading the file chkgamma jpg provided with xli distribution which is a jfif jpeg format file containing two grayscale ramps the ramps are chosen to look linear to the human eye one using continuous tones and the other using dithering if your viewer does the right thing and gamma corrects images then the two ramps should look symmetrical and the point at which they look equally bright should be almost exactly half way from the top to the bottom to find this point it helps if you move away a little from the screen and de focus your eyes a bit if your viewer doesn t do gamma correction then left hand ramp will have a long dark part and a short white part and the point of equal brightness will be above the center if your viewer does have a way of setting the right amount of gamma correction for a display then if the equal brightness point is above center increase the gamma and decrease it if it is below the center the value will usually be around with xli for instance you can adjust the display gamma with the dispgamma flag and once you ve got it right you can set the display gamma environment variable in your profile how do i figure out what the gamma of an image is this is the most tricky bit as a general rule it seems that a lot of true color ie bit ppm jpg images have a gamma of linear although there are many about that have some gamma correction it seems that the majority of pseudo color images ie bit images with color maps gif etc are gamma corrected to some degree or other if your viewer does gamma correction then linear images will look good and gamma corrected images will look too light if your viewer doesn t do gamma correction then linear images will look too dark and gamma corrected images will ok why linear images are sometimes not such a good thing one of the reason that many high quality formats such as video use gamma correction is that it actually makes better use of the storage medium this is because the human eye has a logarithmic response to light and gamma correction has a similar compression characteristic this means images could make better use of bits per color for instance if they used gamma correction the implication though is that every time you want to do any image processing you should convert the bit image to or so linear bits to retain the same accuracy since little popular software does this and none of the popular image formats can agree on a standard gamma correction factor it is difficult to justify gamma corrected images at the popular level if some image formats can standardize on a particular gamma and if image manipulation software takes care to use extra precision when dealing with linearized internal data then gamma corrected distribution of images would be a good thing i am told that the kodak photocd format for instance has a standard gamma correction factor that enables it to get the highest quality out of the bits used to hold the image

for idl and the other should be free those are the general purpose packages i ve heard of besides what terramar has sips was written for aviris imagery i m not sure how general purpose it is you would have to contact goetz or one of his people and ask i have another piece of software pcw that does pc and walsh transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image modification you can compute an image using selected components i ve used it on megabyte aviris images without problems but for the best speed you need an external dsp card it will work without it but large images take quite a while times as long to process that s a freebie if you want it my favorite is idl interactive data language from research systems inc idl is in my opinion much better and infinitely easier its programming language is very strong and easy very pascal like it handles the number crunching very well also personally i like doing the number crunching with idl on the vax or mathematica igor or even excel on the mac if it s not too hairy then bringing it over to nih image for the imaging part i have yet to encounter any situation which that combination couldn t handle and the speed and ease of use compared to iraf was incredible by the way it s mostly astronomical image processing which i ve been doing this means image enhancement cleaning up bad lines pixels and some other traditional

popular geographic and remote sensing image processing package many may think of grass as a geographic information system rather than an image processing package although it is reported to have significant image processing capabilities feature descriptions i use grass because it s public domain and can be obtained through the internet for free grass runs in unix and is written in c the source code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the office of grass integration you then compile the source code for your machine using scripts provided with grass i would recommend grass for someone who already has a workstation and is on a limited budget grass is not very user friendly compared to macintosh software a first review of overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose image enhancement routines fft kelly maurice at vexcel corp in boulder co is a primary user of grass this gentleman has used the grass software and developed multi spectral bands volumetric rendering full color on suns and stardents it was a really effective interface vexcel corp currently has a contract to map part of venus and convert the magellan radar data into contour maps you can call them at or email care of greg vexcel com host configuration requirements if you are willing to run a ux you could install grass on a macintosh which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for satellite data grass is public domain and can run on a high end pc under unix it is raster based has some image processing capability and can display vector data but analysis must be done in the raster environment i have used grass v on a sun workstation and found it easy to use it is best of course for data that are well represented in raster grid cell form availability cerl s office of grass integration ogi maintains an ftp server moon cecer army mil mail regarding this site should be addressed

requirements it runs on intergraph workstations a unix machine similar to a sun though there were rumors there are always rumors that the software would be ported to pc and possibly a sun environment pci a company called pci inc out of richmond hill ontario canada makes an array of software utilities for processing manipulation and use of remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard formats lgsowg bsq landsat and a couple of others whose titles i forget the software is available in versions for ms dos unix workstations among them hp sun and ibm and vms and quite possibly other platforms by now i use the vms version the pci software consists of several classes groups packages of utilities grouped by function but all operating on a common pci database disk file the tape i o package is a set of utility programs which read from the various remote sensing industry tape formats into or write those formats out from the pci database file this is the only package i use or know much about other packages can display data from the pci database to one or another of several pci supported third party color displays output numeric or bitmap representation of image data to an attached printer e g an epson type dot matrix graphics printer you might be more spe cifically interested in the mathematical operations package histo gram and fourier analysis equalization user specified operations e g multiply channel by add channel and store as channel and god only knows what all else there s a lot i don t have and don t use these so can t say much about them you only buy the packages your particular application interest calls for each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters read from a common parameter file which must be in vms anyway in your default directory some utilities will share parameters and use the same parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing setting up a series of operations the standard pci environment contains a scripting language very similar to ibm pc basic but which allows you to automate the process of setting up parameters for a common complicated lengthy or difficult series of utility executions in vms i can also invoke utilities independently from a dcl command procedure there s also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled language programs which can interface with read from write to the pci data structures database file parameter file the pci software is designed specifically for remote sensing images but requires such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the level where you can handle r s images you can figure out ways to handle a few other things as well for instance the tape i o package offers a utility for reading headerless multi band what adobe photoshop on the macintosh calls raw data from tape in a number of different interleave orders this turns out to be ideal for manipulating the graphic arts industry s ct t format would probably i haven t tried handle targa and so on above all however you have to know what you re doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start over it s worth noting that the pci database file is designed to contain not only raster image data but vectors for overlaying map information entered via digitizing table land use and all manner of other information i observe that a remote sensing image tape often contains all manner of information about the spectral bands latitude longitude time date etc of the original satellite pass all of this can go into the pci database i believe that on workstations the built in display is used on vax systems other than workstations pci supports only a couple of specific third party display systems the name gould deanza seems to come to mind one of my personal workarounds was a display program which would display directly from a pci database file to a peritek vct q q bus bit directcolor display subsystem pci software could be overkill in your case it seems designed for the very high end applications users i e those for whom a mac pc largely doesn t suffice although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time it s probably no coincidence that pci is located in canada a country which does a lot of its land resource management via remote sensing i believe the canadian government uses pci software for some of its work in these areas spam spectral analysis manager back in jpl developed something called spam spectral analysis manager which got a fair amount of use at the time that was designed for airborne imaging spectrometer imagery byte data pixels across by lines by bands a modified version has since been developed for aviris airborne visual and infrared imaging spectrometer which uses much larger images spam does none of these things rectification classification pc and ihs transformations filtering contrast enhancement overlays actually it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement stretching spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering the original spam uses x or sunview to display the aviris version may require vicar an executive based on tae and may also require a

2222###comp.graphics###re removing distortion from bitmapped drawings in article apr sctc com boebert sctc com earl boebert writes let s say you have a scanned image of a line drawing in this case a boat but it could be anything on the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true x y positions are known now you digitize the drawing manually in this case using yaron danon s excellent digitize program that is you use a program which converts cursor positions to x y and saves those values when you click the mouse upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values this is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper errors introduced in the printing process scanner errors and what have you the errors are not uniform over the entire drawing so global adjustments such as stretching contracting uniformly over x or y or rotating the whole drawing are not satisfactory so the question is does any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion in particular if i have three sets of points reference x y the known true values distortedreference x y the same points with known errors distorteddata x y other points with unknown errors what function of reference and distorted could i apply to distorteddata to remove the errors i suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference points as resulting from the projection of a bumpy d surface solving for the surface and then flattening it to remove the errors in the other data points it helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion or at least a reasonable model of the class of distortion below is a very short description of the process which we use if you have further questions feel free to poke me via e mail assume locally smooth distortion compute the delaunay triangulation of your x y points this defines the set of neighbors for each point if your data are not naturally convex you may have very long edges on the convex hull consider deleting these edges now there are two goals a move the distorteddata x y to the reference x y b keep the length e as measured from the current x y s as close as possible to the digitizedlength e as measured using the digitized x y s for every point compute a displacement based on a and b for example a for x y points for which you know the reference x y you can move alpha reference x y current x y this will slowly move the distortedreference x y towards the reference x y b for all other points examine the current length of each edge for each edge compute a displacement which would make that edge the correct length where correct is the digitizedlength take the vector sum of these edge displacements and move the point alpha sumofedgedisplacements this will keep the triangulated mesh consistent with your digitized mesh iterate until you are happy for example no point moves very much alpha and alpha need to be determined by experimentation consider how much you believe the reference x y i e do you absolutely insist on the final points exactly matching the references or do you want to balance some error in matching the reference against changes in length of the edges warning there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be observed essentially you can t allow the convex hull to change and you can t allow triangles to fold over neighboring triangles both of these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of individual points or by periodically re triangulating the points using the current positions but still calculating digitizedlength from the original positions when we first did this the triangulation time was prohibitive so we only did it once if i were motivated to try and change code that has been working in production mode for years i might go back and re triangulate on every iteration if you have more compute power than you know what to do with you might consider having every point interact with every other point but first read up on linear solutions to the n body problem there are lots of papers in the last years of siggraph proceedings on springs constraints and energy calculations which are

general purpose packages i ve heard of besides what terramar has sips was written for aviris imagery i m not sure how general purpose it is you would have to contact goetz or one of his people and ask i have another piece of software pcw that does pc and walsh transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image modification you can compute an image using selected components i ve used it on megabyte aviris images without problems but for the best speed you need an external dsp card it will work without it but large images take quite a while times as long to process that s a freebie if you want it my favorite is idl interactive data language from research systems inc idl is in my opinion much better and infinitely easier its programming language is very strong and easy very pascal like it handles the number crunching very well also personally i like doing the number crunching with idl on the vax or mathematica igor or even excel on the mac if it s not too hairy then bringing it over to nih image for the imaging part i have yet to encounter any situation which that combination couldn t handle and the speed and ease of use compared to iraf was incredible by the way

intergraph workstations a unix machine similar to a sun though there were rumors there are always rumors that the software would be ported to pc and possibly a sun environment pci a company called pci inc out of richmond hill ontario canada makes an array of software utilities for processing manipulation and use of remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard formats lgsowg bsq landsat and a couple of others whose titles i forget the software is available in versions for ms dos unix workstations among them hp sun and ibm and vms and quite possibly other platforms by now i use the vms version the pci software consists of several classes groups packages of utilities grouped by function but all operating on a common pci database disk file the tape i o package is a set of utility programs which read from the various remote sensing industry tape formats into or write those formats out from the pci database file this is the only package i use or know much about other packages can display data from the pci database to one or another of several pci supported third party color displays output numeric or bitmap representation of image data to an attached printer e g an epson type dot matrix graphics printer you might be more spe cifically interested in the mathematical operations package histo gram and fourier analysis equalization user specified operations e g multiply channel by add channel and store as channel and god only knows what all else there s a lot i don t have and don t use these so can t say much about them you only buy the packages your particular application interest calls for each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters read from a common parameter file which must be in vms anyway in your default directory some utilities will share parameters and use the same parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing setting up a series of operations the standard pci environment contains a scripting language very similar to ibm pc basic but which allows you to automate the process of setting up parameters for a common complicated lengthy or difficult series of utility executions in vms i can also invoke utilities independently from a dcl command procedure there s also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled language programs which can interface with read from write to the pci data structures database file parameter file the pci software is designed specifically for remote sensing images but requires such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the level where you can handle r s images you can figure out ways to handle a few other things as well for instance the tape i o package offers a utility for reading headerless multi band what adobe photoshop on the macintosh calls raw data from tape in a number of different interleave orders this turns out to be ideal for manipulating the graphic arts industry s ct t format would probably i haven t tried handle targa and so on above all however you have to know what you re doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start over it s worth noting that the pci database file is

happened had the people come out with their hands up several weeks ago it didn t happen and who is responsible for it not happening certainly not the children koresh was calling the shots he was talking with his lawyer and the fbi since others were released safely there is no sane reason for keeping the children inside the compound the fbi and koresh were calling the shots and there were very sane reasons for keeping the children if they let them go the parents would never see them again that is not an easy choice in spite of you cold attitude about it scenario that is simplest and most plausible i do not generally believe in conspiracy theories that involve complicated and unlikely scenarios the fbi sent letters to martin luther king s wife insinuating that mlk was having an affair again please tell us exactly how much you trust our supposedly benevolent government more than someone who would not release children from the compound obviously you are an authority worshiper not at all are you a koresh worshiper i am a constitution worshiper you quite obviously eat anything the authorities feed you without doubt which makes you no different that a koresh worshiper i e more than david koresh vernon howell jesus christ i saw lengthy excerpts from an australian documentary made in that clearly showed that this was a cult give me a camera and time with you and i can present excerpts that show you to be a cult leader guarenteed thanks for my laugh of the day definitely a very silly supposition if you do not believe this you are truly naive it is not only possible it is easy i worked in the broadcast profession at a network station in the late s i know what i m saying here embarrasing footage is easy to get add a little sinister music and the right voice over and i ll have you mother agreeing to commit you you should at least view the whole documentary before you claim it as a source i would if i could the news show that showed the lengthy excerpts also had interviews with the filmmaker who made the documentary who basically confirmed what was shown in the excerpts from the time he spent at the compound in the news shows were looking for excerpts which backed their position do you think they would show excerpts which disproved their points i am not pleased with the batf handling of the affair i think they bungled it badly from the start but i don t think they are responsible for the fire which started in two different places two places eh you saw this or did the wonderful fbi tell you this i saw one place i believe that this was reported by local radio reporters on site a fire started in a three story tower at the same time as the two story window shown on the tv coverage the reports of multi starts came solely from the fbi anyone observing the fire from the available video would be hard pressed to see more than one point of fire which spread across the compound as a uniform rate the batf is by no means devoid of fault in the handling of this affair but to suggest that they may have intentionally started the fire is ludicrous i suspect that there were plenty of camerapeople willing to risk small arms fire to get some good footage these people were told to get the hell out of camera range why couldn t answer this one eh this is the most important question of all it is the root cause of all the other suspicion i thought about mentioning how reagan and the military treated the press in grenada and how that set the precedent but decided it wasn t worthy of discussion if the news reporter got shot you can bet his family would sue the government for letting him into the danger area no reported has ever sued the government for such a situation they know the dangers remember the batf invited the initial coverage and how about a simple remote controlled camera or two there were ways to provide media access the fbi obviously just didn t want any the root cause of suspicion in my mind is why people wouldn t flee a building that had numerous exits during the minutes time it took to burn down or why didn t they flee hours earlier when the tear gas was first introduced i can find no rational explanation for their behavior i can find several tear gas and smoke making it impossible to remove the barricades flames blocking exits to the saferooms perhaps the gun shots were from the fbi keeping them pinned in who

applications robotics medical satellite engineering oil exploration etc it is called hips and deals with sequences of multiband images in the same way it deals with single images it has been growing since we first wrote it both by additions from us as well as a huge user contributed library feature description hips is a set of image processing modules which together provide a powerful suite of tools for those interested in research system development and teaching it handles sequences of images movies in precisely the same manner as single frames programs and subroutines have been developed for simple image transformations filtering convolution fourier and other transform processing edge detection and line drawing manipulation digital image compression and transmission methods noise generation and image statistics computation over such image transformation programs have been developed as a result almost any image processing task can be performed quickly and conveniently additionally hips allows users to easily integrate their own custom routines new users become effective using hips on their first day hips features images that are self documenting each image stored in the system contains a history of the transformations that have been applied to that image hips includes a small set of subroutines which primarily deals with a standardized image sequence header and a large library of image transformation tools in the form of unix filters it comes complete with source code on line manual pages and on line documentation host configuration requirements originally developed at new york university hips now represents one of the most extensive and flexible vision and image processing environments currently available it runs under the unix operating system it is modular and flexible provides automatic documentation of its actions and is almost entirely independent of special equipment hips is now in use on a variety of computers including vax and

applications robotics medical satellite engineering oil exploration etc it is called hips and deals with sequences of multiband images in the same way it deals with single images it has been growing since we first wrote it both by additions from us as well as a huge user contributed library feature description hips is a set of image processing modules which together provide a powerful suite of tools for those interested in research system development and teaching it handles sequences of images movies in precisely the same manner as single frames programs and subroutines have been developed for simple image transformations filtering convolution fourier and other transform processing edge detection and line drawing manipulation digital image compression and transmission methods noise generation and image statistics computation over such image transformation programs have been developed as a result almost any image processing task can be performed quickly and conveniently additionally hips allows users to easily integrate their own custom routines new users become effective using hips on their first day hips features images that are self documenting each image stored in the system contains a history of the transformations that have been applied to that image hips includes a small set of subroutines which primarily deals with a standardized image sequence header

mike wading through the muck and meyer in article may hal com bobp hal com bob pendleton writes this is getting pretty silly first off hacker is an obsolete term doesn t matter what it used to mean today it means thief it only means thief if you want it to mean that to me it means lots of context wickedly omitted by myself anyway if i say joe is a hacker to most english speaking people who know the word they ll probably think he is either a poor golfer or a bad carpenter but there are very very few people who will think he is a good and clever programmer if you chose to call yourself by a term that means thief don t be surprised when people think you are a thief even if you don t agree with that definition of the word the narrower view that a hacker when associated with the computing environment is a dishonest expert is not so widespread i m my opinion at least with the people involved with the field imho the wider meaning is not obsolete at all no matter how much the lay press would like it to be therefore i conclude that if you call yourself a hacker and somebody perceives you as a thief then this person belongs to a very very small group that has some computer knowledge but not enough to know the wider and original meaning of the word unfortunately the general public has a very narrow view of the deep dark recesses of the art of computing what little they do see is from the view given to them by the media from what i have seen from the media hacker is not a proper way by which to refer to a respected person i on the other hand know what hacker means from those who consider themselves such following is the definition from jargon file this is also known as the hackers dictionary the definitions are arranged in order of decreasing frequency of usage hacker originally someone who makes furniture with an axe n a person who enjoys exploring the details of programmable systems and how to stretch their capabilities as opposed to most users who prefer to learn only the minimum necessary one who programs enthusiastically even obsessively or who enjoys programming rather than just theorizing about programming a person capable of appreciating hack value a person who is good at programming quickly an expert at a particular program or one who frequently does work using it or on it as in a unix hacker definitions through are correlated and people who fit them congregate an expert or enthusiast of any kind one might be an astronomy hacker for example one who enjoys the intellectual challenge of creatively overcoming or circumventing limitations deprecated a malicious meddler who tries to discover sensitive information by poking around hence password hacker network hacker see cracker the term hacker also tends to connote membership in the global community defined by the net see network the and internet address it also implies that the person described is seen to subscribe to some version of the hacker ehic see hacker ethic the it is better to be described as a hacker by others than to describe oneself that way hackers consider themselves something of an elite a meritocracy based on ability though one to which new members are gladly welcome there is thus a certain ego satisfaction to be had in identifying yourself as a hacker but if you claim to be one and are not you ll quickly be labeled bogus see also wannabee hacker ethic the n the belief that information sharing is a powerful positive good and that it is an ethical duty of hackers to share their expertise by writing free software and facilitating access to information and to computing resources wherever possible the belief that system cracking for fun and exploration is ethically ok as long as the cracker commits no theft vandalism or breach of confidentiality both of these normative ethical principles are widely but by no means universally accepted among hackers most hackers subscribe to the hacker ethic in sense and many act on it by writing and giving away free software a few go further and assert that all information should be free and any proprietary control of it is bad this is the philosophy behind the gnu project sense is more controversial some people consider the act of cracking itself to be unethical like breaking and entering but this principle at least moderates the behavior of people who see themselves as benign crackers see also samurai on this view it is one of the highest forms of hackerly courtesy to a break into a system and then b explain to the sysop preferably by email from a superuser account exactly how it was done and how the hole can be plugged acting as an unpaid an unsolicited tiger team the most reliable manifestation of either version of the hacker ethic is that almost all hackers are actively willing to share technical tricks software and where possible computing resources with other hackers huge cooperative networks such as usenet fidonet and internet see internet address can function without central control because of this trait they both rely on and reinforce a sense of community that may be hackerdom s most valuable intangible asset finally a true hacker does not name himself herself one for this is a title that is bestowed by the befuddled sysadmins and users at large to me a sign of a truly great hacker is to be introduced to someone who says nahh i just know a thing or two people always exagerate note that the above definition does not preclude a hacker from describing limself meaning himself herself one but simply says that it is better not to do so there are many who do not know the meaning of hacker so in order to defend the true meaning of the word it is sometimes necessary to borrow on the reputation of a known respected hacker around the workplace this means that hacker is defined in terms of some well known and respected person sometimes there may only be one such person no matter what mr dumpty says language doesn t work that way actually it does you just have to get adequate press coverage language works anyway that we want it to work the purpose of language is to communicate to oversimplify as long as communication is taking place then
