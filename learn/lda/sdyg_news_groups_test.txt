system it is modular and flexible provides automatic documentation of its actions and is almost entirely independent of special equipment hips is now in use on a variety of computers including vax and microvax sun apollo masscomp ncr tower iris ibm at etc for image display and input drivers are supplied for the grinnell and adage ikonas image processors and the sun sun sun and sun i consoles we also supply user contributed drivers for a number of other framestores and windowing packages sun gfx sun console matrox vip iti ip lexidata macintosh ii x windowing system and iris the hipsaddon package includes an interface for the crs it is a simple matter to interface hips with other frame stores and we can put interested users in touch with users who have interfaced hips with the arlunya and datacube max video hips can be easily adapted for other image display devices because of hips is machine independent availability hips has proven itself a highly flexible system both as an interactive research tool and for more production oriented tasks it is both easy to use and quickly adapted and extended to new uses hips is supplied on magnetic tape in unix tar format either reel to

for idl and the other should be free those are the general purpose packages i ve heard of besides what terramar has sips was written for aviris imagery i m not sure how general purpose it is you would have to contact goetz or one of his people and ask i have another piece of software pcw that does pc and walsh transformations with pseudocoloring and clustering and limited image modification you can compute an image using selected components i ve used it on megabyte aviris images without problems but for the best speed you need an external dsp card it will work without it but large images take quite a while times as long to process that s a freebie if you want it my favorite is idl interactive data language from research systems inc idl is in my opinion much better and infinitely easier its programming language is very strong and easy very pascal like it handles the number crunching very well also personally i like doing the number crunching with idl on the vax or mathematica igor or even excel on the mac if it s not too hairy then bringing it over to nih image for the imaging part i have yet to encounter any situation which that combination couldn t handle and the speed and ease of use compared to iraf was incredible by the way it s mostly astronomical image processing which i ve been doing this means image enhancement cleaning up bad lines pixels and some other traditional

input available via anonymous ftp at rani chem yale edu directory pub mindtool check with archie for other sites if that s too far i would also suggest looking at least in sgi s applications directory it contains many more packages nfotis gis geographical information systems software grass geographic resource analysis support system of the us army construction engineering research lab cerl it is a popular geographic and remote sensing image processing package many may think of grass as a geographic information system rather than an image processing package although it is reported to have significant image processing capabilities feature descriptions i use grass because it s public domain and can be obtained through the internet for free grass runs in unix and is written in c the source code can be obtained through an anonymous ftp from the office of grass integration you then compile the source code for your machine using scripts provided with grass i would recommend grass for someone who already has a workstation and is on a limited budget grass is not very user friendly compared to macintosh software a first review of overview documentation indicates that it looks useful and has some pixel resampling functions not in other packages plus good general purpose image enhancement routines fft kelly maurice at vexcel corp in boulder co is a primary user of grass this gentleman has used the grass software and developed multi spectral bands volumetric rendering full color on suns and stardents it was a really effective interface vexcel corp currently has a contract to map part of venus and convert the magellan radar data into contour maps you can call them at or email care of greg vexcel com host configuration requirements if you are willing to run a ux you could install grass on a macintosh which has significant image analysis and import capabilities for satellite data grass is public domain and can run on a high end pc under unix it is raster based has some image processing capability and can display vector data but analysis must be done in the raster environment i have used grass v on a sun workstation and found it easy to use it is best of course for data that are well represented in raster grid cell form availability cerl s office of grass integration ogi maintains an ftp server moon cecer army mil mail regarding this site should be addressed to grass ftp admin moon cecer army mil this location will be the new canonical source for grass software as well as bug fixes contributed sources documentation and other files this ftp server also supports dynamic compression and uncompression and tar archiving of files a feature attraction of the server is john parks grass tutorial because the manual is still in beta test stage john requests

sells a wide range of gis software hardware microstation is a base graphics package that imager sits on top of imager is basically an image processing package with a heavy gis remote sensing flavor feature description basic geometry manipulations flip mirror rotate generalized affine rectification affine nd rd th and th order models as well as a projective model warp an image to a vector map or to another image rgb to ihs and ihs to rgb conversion principal component analysis classification k means and isodata fourier xforms forward filtering and reverse filters high pass low pass edge enhancing median generic complex histogram contrast control layer controller manages up to images at a time user can extract single bands from a band image or create color images by combining various individual bands etc the package is designed for a remote sensing application it can handle very large images and there is all kinds of other software available for gis applications host configuration requirements it runs on intergraph workstations a unix machine similar to a sun though there were rumors there are always rumors that the software would be ported to pc and possibly a sun environment pci a company called pci inc out of richmond hill ontario canada makes an array of software utilities for processing manipulation and use of remote sensing data in eight or ten different industry standard formats lgsowg bsq landsat and a couple of others whose titles i forget the software is available in versions for ms dos unix workstations among them hp sun and ibm and vms and quite possibly other platforms by now i use the vms version the pci software consists of several classes groups packages of utilities grouped by function but all operating on a common pci database disk file the tape i o package is a set of utility programs which read from the various remote sensing industry tape formats into or write those formats out from the pci database file this is the only package i use or know much about other packages can display data from the pci database to one or another of several pci supported third party color displays output numeric or bitmap representation of image data to an attached printer e g an epson type dot matrix graphics printer you might be more spe cifically interested in the mathematical operations package histo gram and fourier analysis equalization user specified operations e g multiply channel by add channel and store as channel and god only knows what all else there s a lot i don t have and don t use these so can t say much about them you only buy the packages your particular application interest calls for each utility is controlled by from one to eight parameters read from a common parameter file which must be in vms anyway in your default directory some utilities will share parameters and use the same parameter for a different purpose so it can get a bit confusing setting up a series of operations the standard pci environment contains a scripting language very similar to ibm pc basic but which allows you to automate the process of setting up parameters for a common complicated lengthy or difficult series of utility executions in vms i can also invoke utilities independently from a dcl command procedure there s also an optional programming library which allows you to write compiled language programs which can interface with read from write to the pci data structures database file parameter file the pci software is designed specifically for remote sensing images but requires such a level of operator expertise that once you reach the level where you can handle r s images you can figure out ways to handle a few other things as well for instance the tape i o package offers a utility for reading headerless multi band what adobe photoshop on the macintosh calls raw data from tape in a number of different interleave orders this turns out to be ideal for manipulating the graphic arts industry s ct t format would probably i haven t tried handle targa and so on above all however you have to know what you re doing or you can screw up to the nth degree and have to start over it s worth noting that the pci database file is designed to contain not only raster image data but vectors for overlaying map information entered via digitizing table land use and all manner of other information i observe that a remote sensing image tape often contains all manner of information about the spectral bands latitude longitude time date etc of the original satellite pass all of this can go into the pci database i believe that on workstations the built in display is used on vax systems other than workstations pci supports only a couple of specific third party display systems the name gould deanza seems to come to mind one of my personal workarounds was a display program which would display directly from a pci database file to a peritek vct q q bus bit directcolor display subsystem pci software could be overkill in your case it seems designed for the very high end applications users i e those for whom a mac pc largely doesn t suffice although as you know the gap is getting smaller all the time it s probably no coincidence that pci is located in canada a country which does a lot of its land resource management via remote sensing i believe the canadian government uses pci software for some of its work in these areas spam spectral analysis manager back in jpl developed something called spam spectral analysis manager which got a fair amount of use at the time that was designed for airborne imaging spectrometer imagery byte data pixels across by lines by bands a modified version has since been developed for aviris airborne visual and infrared imaging spectrometer which uses much larger images spam does none of these things rectification classification pc and ihs transformations filtering contrast enhancement overlays actually it does limited filtering and contrast enhancement stretching spam is aimed at spectral identification and clustering the original spam uses x or sunview to display the aviris version may require vicar an executive based on tae and may also require a frame buffer i can refer you to people if you re interested pcw requires x for display map ii among the mac gis systems map ii is distributed by john wiley clrview clrview is a dimensional

myname mysite to specify your correct e mail address to reply to what is jpeg jpeg pronounced jay peg is a standardized image compression mechanism jpeg stands for joint photographic experts group the original name of the committee that wrote the standard jpeg is designed for compressing either full color or gray scale digital images of natural real world scenes it does not work so well on non realistic images such as cartoons or line drawings jpeg does not handle black and white bit per pixel images nor does it handle motion picture compression standards for compressing those types of images are being worked on by other committees named jbig and mpeg respectively jpeg is lossy meaning that the image you get out of decompression isn t quite identical to what you originally put in the algorithm achieves much of its compression by exploiting known limitations of the human eye notably the fact that small color details aren t perceived as well as small details of light and dark thus jpeg is intended for compressing images that will be looked at by humans if you plan to machine analyze your images the small errors introduced by jpeg may be a problem for you even if they are invisible to the eye a useful property of jpeg is that the degree of lossiness can be varied by adjusting compression parameters this means that the image maker can trade off file size against output image quality you can make extremely small files if you don t mind poor quality this is useful for indexing image archives making thumbnail views or icons etc etc conversely if you aren t happy with the output quality at the default compression setting you can jack up the quality until you are satisfied and accept lesser compression why use jpeg there are two good reasons to make your image files smaller and to store bit per pixel color data instead of bit per pixel data making image files smaller is a big win for transmitting files across networks and for archiving libraries of images being able to compress a mbyte full color file down to kbytes or so makes a big difference in disk space and transmission time if you are comparing gif and jpeg the size ratio is more like four to one more details below if your viewing software doesn t support jpeg directly you ll have to convert jpeg to some other format for viewing or manipulating images even with a jpeg capable viewer it takes longer to decode and view a jpeg image than to view an image of a simpler format gif for instance thus using jpeg is essentially a time space tradeoff you give up some time in order to store or transmit an image more cheaply it s worth noting that when network or phone transmission is involved the time savings from transferring a shorter file can be much greater than the extra time to decompress the file i ll let you do the arithmetic yourself the other reason why jpeg will gradually replace gif as a standard usenet posting format is that jpeg can store full color information bits pixel million colors instead of or less or fewer colors if you have only bit display hardware then this may not seem like much of an advantage to you within a couple of years though bit gif will look as obsolete as black and white macpaint format does today furthermore for reasons detailed in section jpeg is far more useful than gif for exchanging images among people with widely varying color display hardware hence jpeg is considerably more appropriate than gif for use as a usenet posting standard when should i use jpeg and when should i stick with gif jpeg is not going to displace gif entirely for some types of images gif is superior in image quality file size or both one of the first things to learn about jpeg is which kinds of images to apply it to as a rule of thumb jpeg is superior to gif for storing full color or gray scale images of realistic scenes that means scanned photographs and similar material jpeg is superior even if you don t have bit display hardware and it is a lot superior if you do see section for details gif does significantly better on images with only a few distinct colors such as cartoons and line drawings in particular large areas of pixels that are all exactly the same color are compressed very efficiently indeed by gif jpeg can t squeeze these files as much as gif does without introducing visible defects this sort of image is best kept in gif form in particular single color borders are quite cheap in gif files but they should be avoided in jpeg files jpeg also has a hard time with very sharp edges a row of pure black pixels adjacent to a row of pure white pixels for example sharp edges tend to come out blurred unless you use a very high quality setting again this sort of thing is not found in scanned photographs but it shows up fairly often in gif files borders overlaid text etc the blurriness is particularly objectionable with text that s only a few pixels high if you have a gif with a lot of small size overlaid text don t jpeg it computer drawn images ray traced scenes for instance usually fall between scanned images and cartoons in terms of complexity the more complex and subtly rendered the image the more likely that jpeg will do well on it the same goes for semi realistic artwork fantasy drawings and such plain black and white two level images should never be converted to jpeg you need at least about gray levels before jpeg is useful for gray scale images it should also be noted that gif is lossless for gray scale images of up to levels while jpeg is not if you have an existing library of gif images you may wonder whether you should convert them to jpeg you will lose a little image quality if you do section which argues that jpeg image quality is superior to gif only applies if both formats start from a full color original if you start from a gif you ve already irretrievably lost a great deal of information jpeg can only make things worse however the disk space savings may justify converting anyway this is a decision you ll have to make for yourself if you do convert a gif library to jpeg see section for hints be prepared to leave some images in gif format since some gifs will not convert well how well does jpeg compress images pretty darn well here are some sample file sizes for an image i have handy a x full color image of a ship in a harbor the first three files are for comparison purposes the rest were created with the free jpeg software described in section b file size in bytes comments ship ppm original file in ppm format no compression bits or bytes per pixel plus a few bytes overhead ship ppm z ppm file passed through unix compress compress doesn t accomplish a lot you ll note other text oriented compressors give similar results ship gif converted to gif with ppmquant fs ppmtogif most of the savings is the result of losing color info gif saves bits pixel not see sec ship jpg cjpeg q highest useful quality setting this is indistinguishable from the bit original at least to my nonprofessional eyeballs ship jpg cjpeg q default setting you have to look mighty darn close to distinguish this from the original even with both on screen at once ship jpg cjpeg q this has slight defects if you know what to look for you could tell it s been jpeged without seeing the original still as good image quality as many recent postings in usenet pictures groups ship jpg cjpeg q jpeg s characteristic blockiness becomes apparent at this setting djpeg blocksmooth helps some still i ve seen plenty of usenet postings that were of poorer image quality than this ship jpg o cjpeg q optimize optimize cuts table overhead blocky but perfectly satisfactory for preview or indexing purposes note that this file is tiny the compression ratio from the original is in this case jpeg can make a file that s a factor of four or five smaller than a gif of comparable quality the q file is every bit as good as the gif better if you have a full color display this seems to be a typical ratio for real world scenes what are good quality settings for jpeg most jpeg compressors let you pick a file size vs image quality tradeoff by selecting a quality setting there seems to be widespread confusion about the meaning of these settings quality does not mean keep of the information as some have claimed the quality scale is purely arbitrary it s not a percentage of anything the name of the game in using jpeg is to pick the lowest quality setting smallest file size that decompresses into an image indistinguishable from the original this setting will vary from one image to another and from one observer to another but here are some rules of thumb the default quality setting q is very often the best choice this setting is about the lowest you can go without expecting to see defects in a typical image try q first if you see defects then go up except for experimental purposes never go above q saying q will produce a file two or three times as large as q but of hardly any better quality if the image was less than perfect quality to begin with you might be able to go down to q without objectionable degradation on the other hand you might need to go to a higher quality setting to avoid further degradation the second case seems to apply much of the time when converting gifs to jpeg the default q is about right for compressing bit images but q to is usually better for converting gifs see section for more info if you want a very small file say for preview or indexing purposes and are prepared to tolerate large defects a q setting in the range of to is about right q or so may be amusing as op art note the quality settings discussed in this article apply to the free jpeg software described in section b and to many programs based on it other jpeg implementations such as image alchemy may use a completely different quality scale some programs don t even provide a numeric scale just high medium low style choices where can i get jpeg software most of the programs described in this section are available by ftp if you don t know how to use ftp see the faq article how to find sources if you don t have direct access to ftp read about ftpmail servers in the same article that article appears regularly in news answers or you can get it by sending e mail to mail server rtfm mit edu with send usenet news answers finding sources in the body the anonymous ftp list faq may also be helpful it s usenet news answers ftp list faq in the news answers archive note this list changes constantly if you have a copy more than a couple months old get the latest jpeg faq from the news answers archive a if you are looking for canned software viewers etc the first part of this list is system specific programs that only run on one kind of system if you don t see what you want for your machine check out the portable jpeg software described at the end of the list note that this list concentrates on free and shareware programs that you can obtain over internet but some commercial programs are listed too x windows john bradley s free xv version and up is an excellent viewer for jpeg gif and other image formats it s available for ftp from export lcs mit edu or ftp cis upenn edu the file is called xv tar z where is the version number currently it is located in the contrib directory on export or the pub xv directory at upenn xv reduces all images to bits internally which means it s not a real good choice if you have a bit display you ll still get only bit color also you shouldn t use xv to convert full color images to jpeg because they ll get color quantized first but xv is a fine tool for converting gif and other bit images to jpeg caution there is a glitch in versions and earlier be sure to check the save at normal size checkbox when saving a jpeg file or the file will be blurry another good choice for x windows is john cristy s free imagemagick package also available from export lcs mit edu file contrib imagemagick tar z this package handles many image processing and conversion tasks the imagemagick viewer handles bit displays correctly for colormapped displays it does better though slower color quantization than xv or the basic free jpeg software both of the above are large complex packages if you just want a simple image viewer try xloadimage or xli xloadimage supports jpeg in its latest release xloadimage is free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib xloadimage tar z xli is a variant version of xloadimage said by its fans to be somewhat faster and more robust than the original the current xli is indeed faster and more robust than the current xloadimage at least with respect to jpeg files because it has the ijg v decoder while xloadimage is using a hacked over v the next xloadimage release will fix this xli is also free and available from export lcs mit edu file contrib xli tar z both programs are said to do the right thing with bit displays ms dos this covers plain dos for windows or os programs see the next headings one good choice is eric praetzel s free dvpeg which views jpeg and gif files the current version a is available by ftp from sunee uwaterloo ca file pub jpeg viewers dvpeg a zip this is a good basic viewer that works on either or machines the user interface is not flashy but it s functional another freeware jpeg gif tga viewer is mohammad rezaei s hiview the current version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics hv zip hiview requires a or better cpu and a vcpi compatible memory manager qemm and max work windows and os do not hiview is currently the fastest viewer for images that are no bigger than your screen for larger images it scales the image down to fit on the screen rather than using panning scrolling as most viewers do you may or may not prefer this approach but there s no denying that it slows down loading of large images considerably note installation is a bit tricky read the directions carefully a shareware alternative is colorview for dos this is easier to install than either of the two freeware alternatives its user interface is also much spiffier looking although personally i find it harder to use more keystrokes inconsistent behavior it is faster than dvpeg but a little slower than hiview at least on my hardware for images larger than screen size dvpeg and colorview seem to be about the same speed and both are faster than hiview the current version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics dcview zip requires a vesa graphics driver if you don t have one look in vesadrv zip or vesa tsr zip from the same directory many recent pcs have a built in vesa driver so don t try to load a vesa driver unless colorview complains that the driver is missing a second shareware alternative is fullview which has been kicking around the net for a while but i don t know any stable archive location for it the current rather old version is inferior to the above viewers anyway the author tells me that a new version of fullview will be out shortly and it will be submitted to the simtel archives at that time the well known gif viewer compushow cshow supports jpeg in its latest revision a however cshow s jpeg implementation isn t very good it s slow about half the speed of the above viewers and image quality is poor except on hi color displays too bad it d have been nice to see a good jpeg capability in cshow shareware available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos gif cshw a zip due to the remarkable variety of pc graphics hardware any one of these viewers might not work on your particular machine if you can t get any of them to work you ll need to use one of the following conversion programs to convert jpeg to gif then view with your favorite gif viewer if you have hi color hardware don t use gif as the intermediate format try to find a targa capable viewer instead vpic is reputed to do the right thing with hi color displays the independent jpeg group s free jpeg converters are ftpable from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics jpeg zip or jpeg zip if you have a and extended memory these files are dos compilations of the free source code described in section b they will convert jpeg to and from gif targa and ppm formats handmade software offers free jpeg gif conversion tools gif jpg jpg gif these are slow and are limited to conversion to and from gif format in particular you can t get bit color output from a jpeg the major advantage of these tools is that they will read and write hsi s proprietary jpeg format as well as the usenet standard jfif format since hsi format files are rather widespread on bbses this is a useful capability version of these tools is free prior versions were shareware get it from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics gif jpg zip note do not use hsi format for files to be posted on internet since it is not readable on non pc platforms handmade software also has a shareware image conversion and manipulation package image alchemy this will translate jpeg files both jfif and hsi formats to and from many other image formats it can also display images a demo version of image alchemy version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note below file msdos graphics alch zip note about simtel the internet s key archive site for pc related programs is simtel full name wsmr simtel army mil simtel runs a non unix system with weird directory names where this document refers to directory eg msdos graphics at simtel that really means pd msdos graphics if you are not physically on milnet you should expect rather slow ftp transfer rates from simtel there are several internet sites that maintain copies mirrors of the simtel archives most ftp users should go to one of the mirror sites instead a popular usa mirror site is oak oakland edu which keeps simtel files in eg pub msdos graphics if you have no ftp capability you can retrieve files from simtel by e mail see informational postings in comp archives msdos announce to find out how if you are outside the usa consult the same newsgroup to learn where your nearest simtel mirror is microsoft windows there are several windows programs capable of displaying jpeg images windows viewers are generally slower than dos viewers on the same hardware due to windows system overhead note that you can run the dos conversion programs described above inside a windows dos window the newest entry is winecj which is free and extremely fast version is available from ftp rahul net file pub bryanw pc jpeg wecj zip requires windows and or more colors mode this is a no frills viewer with the bad habit of hogging the machine completely while it decodes and the image quality is noticeably worse than other viewers but it s so fast you ll use it anyway at least for previewing jview is freeware fairly fast has good on line help and can write out the decompressed image in windows bmp format but it can t create new jpeg files and it doesn t view gifs jview also lacks some other useful features of the shareware viewers such as brightness adjustment but it s an excellent basic viewer the current version is available from ftp cica indiana edu file pub pc win desktop jview zip mirrors of this archive can be found at some other internet sites including wuarchive wustl edu winjpeg shareware displays jpeg gif targa tiff and bmp image files it can write all of these formats too so it can be used as a converter it has some other nifty features including color balance adjustment and slideshow the current version is available from simtel and mirror sites see note above file msdos windows winjp zip this is a slow compatible version if you register you ll get the only version which is roughly faster colorview is another shareware entry this was an early and promising contender but it has not been updated in some time and at this point it has no real advantages over winjpeg if you want to try it anyway the current version is available from ftp cica indiana edu file pub pc win desktop cview zip i understand that a new version will be appearing once the authors are finished with colorview for dos dvpeg see dos heading also works under windows but only in full screen mode not in a window os the following files are available from

shareware macintosh most mac jpeg programs rely on apple s jpeg implementation which is part of the quicktime system extension so you need to have quicktime installed to use quicktime you need a or better cpu and you need to be running system or later if you re running system you must also install the bit quickdraw extension this is built in on system you can get quicktime by ftp from ftp apple com file dts mac quicktime quicktime hqx as of this file contains quicktime which is better than qt in several ways with respect to jpeg it is marginally faster and considerably less prone to crash when fed a corrupt jpeg file however some applications seem to have compatibility problems with qt mac users should keep in mind that quicktime s jpeg format pict jpeg is not the same as the usenet standard jfif jpeg format see section for details if you post images on usenet make sure they are in jfif format most of the programs mentioned below can generate either format the first choice is probably jpegview a free program for viewing images that are in jfif format pict jpeg format or gif format it also can convert between the two jpeg formats the current version is a big improvement over prior versions get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app jpeg view hqx requires system and quicktime on bit displays jpegview usually produces the best color image quality of all the currently available mac jpeg viewers jpegview can view large images in much less memory than other mac viewers in fact it s the only one that can deal with jpeg images much over x pixels on a typical mb mac given a large image jpegview automatically scales it down to fit on the screen rather than presenting scroll bars like most other viewers you can zoom in on any desired portion though some people like this behavior some don t overall jpegview s user interface is very well thought out gifconverter a shareware image viewer converter supports jfif and pict jpeg as well as gif and several other image formats the latest version is get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac art gif gif converter hqx requires system or later gifconverter is not better than jpegview as a plain jpeg gif viewer but it has much more extensive image manipulation and format conversion capabilities so you may find it worth its shareware fee if you do a lot of playing around with images also the newest version of gifconverter can load and save jfif images without quicktime so it is your best bet if your machine is too old to run quicktime but it s faster with quicktime note if gifconverter runs out of memory trying to load a large jpeg try converting the file to gif with jpeg convert then viewing the gif version jpeg convert a mac version of the free ijg jpeg conversion utilities is available from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app jpeg convert hqx this will run on any mac but it only does file conversion not viewing you can use it in conjunction with any gif viewer previous versions of this faq recommended imagery jpeg v a jpeg gif converter based on an old version of the ijg code if you are using this program you definitely should replace it with jpeg convert apple s free

requires quicktime pictpixie was intended as a developer s tool and it s really not the best choice unless you like to fool around with quicktime some of its drawbacks are that it requires lots of memory it produces relatively poor color image quality on anything less than a bit display and it has a relatively unfriendly user interface worse pictpixie is an unsupported program meaning it has some minor bugs that apple does not intend to fix there is an old version of pictpixie called pictcompressor floating around the net if you have this you should trash it as it s even buggier also the quicktime starter kit includes a much cleaned up descendant of pictpixie called picture compressor note that picture compressor is not free and may not be distributed on the net storm technology s picture decompress is a free jpeg viewer converter this rather old program is inferior to the above programs in many ways but it will run without system or quicktime so you may be forced to use it on older systems it does need bit quickdraw so really old machines can t use it you can get it from sumex aim stanford edu file info mac app picture decompress hqx you must set the file type of a downloaded image file to jpeg to allow picture decompress to open it if your machine is too old to run bit quickdraw a mac plus for instance gifconverter is your only choice for single program jpeg viewing if you don t want to pay for gifconverter use jpeg convert and a free gif viewer more and more commercial mac applications are supporting jpeg although not all can deal with the usenet standard jfif format adobe photoshop version or later can read and write jfif format jpeg files use the jpeg plug in from the acquire menu you must set the file type of a downloaded jpeg file to jpeg to allow photoshop to recognize it amiga most programs listed in this section are stored in the aminet archive at amiga physik unizh ch there are many mirror sites of this archive and you should try to use the closest one in the usa a good choice is wuarchive wustl edu look under mirrors amiga physik unizh ch hamlab plus is an excellent jpeg viewer converter as well as being a general image manipulation tool it s cheap shareware and can read several formats besides jpeg the current version is a demo version is available from amiga physik unizh ch and mirror sites file amiga gfx edit hamlab d lha the demo version will crop images larger than x but it is otherwise fully functional rend shareware is an image renderer that can display jpeg ilbm and gif images the program can be used to create animations even capturing frames on the fly from rendering packages like lightwave the current version is available from amiga physik unizh ch and mirror sites file amiga os gfx rend lha note although this directory is supposedly for amigados programs the program will also run under amigados or viewtek is a free jpeg ilbm gif anim viewer the current version is available from amiga physik unizh ch and mirror sites file amiga gfx show viewtek lha if you re willing to spend real money there are several commercial packages that support jpeg two are written by thomas krehbiel the author of rend and viewtek these are cinemorph a standalone image morphing package and imagefx an impressive bit image capture conversion editing painting effects and prepress package that also includes cinemorph both are distributed by great valley products art department professional adpro from asdg inc is the most widely used commercial image manipulation software for amigas imagemaster from black belt systems is another well regarded commercial graphics package with jpeg support the free ijg jpeg software is available compiled for amigas from amiga physik unizh ch and mirror sites in directory amiga gfx conv file amigajpegv lha these programs convert jpeg to from ppm gif targa formats the amiga world is heavily infested with quick and dirty jpeg programs many based on an ancient beta test version of the free ijg jpeg software thanks to a certain magazine that published same on its disk of the month without so much as notifying the authors among these are augjpeg newamyjpeg vjpeg and probably others i have not even heard of in my opinion anything older than ijg version march is not worth the disk space it s stored on if you have such a program trash it and get something newer atari st the free ijg jpeg software is available compiled for atari st tt etc from atari archive umich edu file atari graphics jpeg bin zoo these programs convert jpeg to from ppm gif targa formats i have not heard of any free or shareware jpeg capable viewer for ataris but surely there must be one by now pointers appreciated acorn archimedes changefsi supplied with risc os version can convert from and view jpeg jfif format provision is also made to convert images to jpeg although this must be done from the cli rather than by double clicking recent versions since of the shareware program translator can handle jpeg along with about other image formats while older versions can be found on some archimedes bboards the current version is only available by registering with the author john kortink nutterbrink wj enschede the netherlands price dutch guilders about or pounds there s also a commercial product called jpeg which provides jpeg read write functionality and direct jpeg viewing as well as a host of other image format conversion and processing options this is more expensive but not necessarily better than the above programs contact dt software freepost cambridge uk tel portable software for almost any system if none of the above fits your situation you can obtain and compile the free jpeg conversion software described in b you ll also need a viewer program if your display is bits or less any gif viewer will do fine if you have a display with more color capability try to find a viewer that can read targa or ppm bit image files there are numerous commercial jpeg offerings with more popping up every day i recommend that you not spend money on one of these unless you find the available free or shareware software vastly too slow in that case purchase a hardware assisted product ask pointed questions about whether the product complies with the final jpeg standard and about whether it can handle the jfif file format many of the earliest commercial releases are not and never will be compatible with anyone else s files b if you are looking for source code to work with free portable c code for jpeg compression is available from the independent jpeg group which i lead a package containing our source code documentation and some small test files is available from several places the official archive site for this source code is ftp

jpeg jfif format and image files in gif pbmplus ppm pgm utah rle and truevision targa file formats the core compression and decompression modules can easily be reused in other programs such as image viewers the package is highly portable we have tested it on many machines ranging from pcs to crays we have released this software for both noncommercial and commercial use companies are welcome to use it as the basis for jpeg related products we do not ask a royalty although we do ask for an acknowledgement in product literature see the readme file in the distribution for details we hope to make this software industrial quality although as with anything that s free we offer no warranty and accept no liability the independent jpeg group is a volunteer organization if you d like to contribute to improving our software you are welcome to join what s all this hoopla about color quantization most people don t have full color bit per pixel display hardware typical display hardware stores or fewer bits per pixel so it can display or fewer distinct colors at a time to display a full color image the computer must map the image into an appropriate set of representative colors this process is called color quantization this is something of a misnomer color selection would be a better term we re stuck with the standard usage though clearly color quantization is a lossy process it turns out that for most images the details of the color quantization algorithm have much more impact on the final image quality than do any errors introduced by jpeg except at the very lowest jpeg quality settings since jpeg is a full color format converting a color jpeg image for display on bit or less hardware requires color quantization this is true for all color jpegs even if you feed a or less color gif into jpeg what comes out of the decompressor is not colors but thousands of colors this happens because jpeg s lossiness affects each pixel a little differently so two pixels that started with identical colors will probably come out with slightly different colors each original color gets smeared into a group of nearby colors therefore quantization is always required to display a color jpeg on a colormapped display regardless of the image source the only way to avoid quantization is to ask for gray scale output incidentally because of this effect it s nearly meaningless to talk about the number of colors used by a jpeg image even if you attempted to count the number of distinct pixel values different jpeg decoders would give you different results because of roundoff error differences i occasionally see posted images described as color jpeg this tells me that the poster a hasn t read this faq and b probably converted the jpeg from a gif jpegs can be classified as color or gray scale just like photographs but number of colors just isn t a useful concept for jpeg on the other hand a gif image by definition has already been quantized to or fewer colors a gif does have a definite number of colors in its palette and the format doesn t allow more than palette entries for purposes of usenet picture distribution gif has the advantage that the sender precomputes the color quantization so recipients don t have to this is also the disadvantage of gif you re stuck with the sender s quantization if the sender quantized to a different number of colors than what you can display you have to re quantize resulting in much poorer image quality than if you had quantized once from a full color image furthermore if the sender didn t use a high quality color quantization algorithm you re out of luck for this reason jpeg offers the promise of significantly better image quality for all users whose machines don t match the sender s display hardware jpeg s full color image can be quantized to precisely match the user s display hardware furthermore you will be able to take advantage of future improvements in quantization algorithms there is a lot of active research in this area or purchase better display hardware to get a better view of jpeg images you already have with a gif you re stuck forevermore with what was sent it s also worth mentioning that many gif viewing programs include rather shoddy quantization routines if you view a color gif on a color ega display for example you are probably getting a much worse image than you need to this is partly an inevitable consequence of doing two color quantizations one to create the gif one to display it but often it s also due to sloppiness jpeg conversion programs will be forced to use high quality quantizers in order to get acceptable results at all and in normal use they will quantize directly to the number of colors to be displayed thus jpeg is likely to provide better results than the average gif program for low color resolution displays as well as high resolution ones finally an ever growing number of people have better than bit display hardware already bit hi color pc displays true bit displays on workstations and macintoshes etc for these people gif is already obsolete as it cannot represent an image to the full capabilities of their display jpeg images can drive these displays much more effectively thus jpeg is an all around better choice than gif for representing images in a machine independent fashion how does jpeg work the buzz words to know are chrominance subsampling discrete cosine transforms coefficient quantization and huffman or arithmetic entropy coding this article s long enough already so i m not going to say more than that here for technical information see the comp compression faq this is available from the news answers archive at rtfm mit edu in files pub usenet news answers compression faq part if you need help in using the news answers archive see the top of this article what about lossless jpeg there s a great deal of confusion on this subject the jpeg committee did define a truly lossless compression algorithm i e one that guarantees the final output is bit for bit identical to the original input however this lossless mode has almost nothing in common with the regular lossy jpeg algorithm and it offers much less compression at present very few implementations of lossless jpeg exist and all of them are commercial saying q to the free jpeg software does not get you a lossless image what it does get rid of is deliberate information loss in the coefficient quantization step there is still a good deal of information loss in the color subsampling step with the v free jpeg code you can also say sample x to turn off subsampling keep in mind that many commercial jpeg implementations cannot cope with the resulting file even with both quantization and subsampling turned off the regular jpeg algorithm is not lossless because it is subject to roundoff errors in various calculations the maximum error is a few counts in any one pixel value it s highly unlikely that this could be perceived by the human eye but it might be a concern if you are doing machine processing of an image at this minimum loss setting regular jpeg produces files that are perhaps half the size of an uncompressed bit per pixel image true lossless jpeg provides roughly the same amount of compression but it guarantees bit for bit accuracy if you have an application requiring lossless storage of images with less than bits per pixel per color component you may want to look into the jbig bilevel image compression standard this performs better than jpeg lossless on such images jpeg lossless is superior to jbig on images with or more bits per pixel furthermore jpeg is public domain at least with a huffman back end while the jbig techniques are heavily covered by patents why all the argument about file formats strictly speaking jpeg refers only to a family of compression algorithms it does not refer to a specific image file format the jpeg committee was prevented from defining a file format by turf wars within the international standards organizations since we can t actually exchange images with anyone else unless we agree on a common file format this leaves us with a problem in the absence of official standards a number of jpeg program writers have just gone off to do their own thing and as a result their programs aren t compatible with anybody else s the closest thing we have to a de facto standard jpeg format is some work that s been coordinated by people at c cube microsystems they have defined two jpeg based file formats jfif jpeg file interchange format a low end format that transports pixels and not much else tiff jpeg aka tiff an extension of the aldus tiff format tiff is a high end format that will let you record just about everything you ever wanted to know about an image and a lot more besides tiff is a lot more complex than jfif and may well prove less transportable because different vendors have historically implemented slightly different and incompatible subsets of tiff it s not likely that adding jpeg to the mix will do anything to improve this situation both of these formats were developed with input from all the major vendors of jpeg related products it s reasonably likely that future commercial products will adhere to one or both standards i believe that usenet should adopt jfif as the replacement for gif in picture postings jfif is simpler than tiff and is available now the tiff spec has only recently been officially adopted and it is still unusably vague on some crucial details even when tiff jpeg is well defined the jfif format is likely to be a widely supported lowest common denominator tiff jpeg files may never be as transportable a particular case that people may be interested in is apple s quicktime software for the macintosh quicktime uses a jfif compatible format wrapped inside the mac specific pict structure conversion between jfif and quicktime jpeg is pretty straightforward and several mac programs are available to do it see mac portion of section a if you have an editor that handles binary files you can strip a quicktime jpeg pict down to jfif by hand see section for details another particular case is handmade software s programs gif jpg jpg gif and image alchemy these programs are capable of reading and writing jfif format by default though they write a proprietary format developed by hsi this format is not readable by any non hsi programs and should not be used for usenet postings use the j switch to get jfif output this applies to old versions of these programs the current releases emit jfif format by default you still should be careful not to post hsi format files unless you want to get flamed by people on non pc platforms how do i recognize which file format i have and what do i do about it if you have an alleged jpeg file that your software won t read it s likely to be hsi format or some other proprietary jpeg based format you can tell what you have by inspecting the first few bytes of the file a jfif standard file will start with the characters hex ff d ff e followed by two variable bytes often hex followed by jfif if you see ff d at the start but not the rest of it you may have a raw jpeg file this is probably decodable as is by jfif software it s worth a try anyway hsi files start with hsi you re out of luck unless you have hsi software portions of the file may look like plain jpeg data but they won t decompress properly with non hsi programs a macintosh pict file if jpeg compressed will have a couple hundred bytes of header followed by a jfif header scan for jfif strip off everything before the ff d and you should be able to read it anything else it s a proprietary format or not jpeg at all if you are lucky the file may consist of a header and a raw jpeg data stream if you can identify the start of the jpeg data stream look for ff d try stripping off everything before that in uuencoded usenet postings the characteristic jfif pattern is begin line m c x whereas uuencoded hsi files will start with begin line m i if you learn to check for the former you can save yourself the trouble of downloading non jfif files what about arithmetic coding the jpeg spec defines two different back end modules for the final output of compressed data either huffman coding or arithmetic coding is allowed the choice has no impact on image quality but arithmetic coding usually produces a smaller compressed file on typical images arithmetic coding produces a file or percent smaller than huffman coding all the file size numbers previously cited are for huffman coding unfortunately the particular variant of arithmetic coding specified by the jpeg standard is subject to patents owned by ibm at t and mitsubishi thus you cannot legally use arithmetic coding unless you obtain licenses from these companies the fair use doctrine allows people to implement and test the algorithm but actually storing any images with it is dubious at best at least in the short run i recommend that people not worry about arithmetic coding the space savings isn t great enough to justify the potential legal hassles in particular arithmetic coding should not be used for any images to be exchanged on usenet there is some small chance that the legal situation may change in the future stay tuned for further details does loss accumulate with repeated compression decompression it would be nice if having compressed an image with jpeg you could decompress it manipulate it crop off a border say and recompress it without any further image degradation beyond what you lost initially unfortunately this is not the case in general recompressing an altered image loses more information though usually not as much as was lost the first time around the next best thing would be that if you decompress an image and recompress it without changing it then there is no further loss i e you get an identical jpeg file even this is not true at least not with the current free jpeg software it s essentially a problem of accumulation of roundoff error if you repeatedly compress and decompress the image will eventually degrade to where you can see visible changes from the first generation output it usually takes many such cycles to get visible change one of the things on our to do list is to see if accumulation of error can be avoided or limited but i am not optimistic about it in any case the most that could possibly be guaranteed would be that compressing the unmodified full color output of djpeg at the original quality setting would introduce no further loss even such simple changes as cropping off a border could cause further roundoff error degradation if you re wondering why it s because the pixel block boundaries move if you cropped off only multiples of pixels you might be safe but that s a mighty limited capability the bottom line is that jpeg is a useful format for archival storage and transmission of images but you don t want to use it as an intermediate format for sequences of image manipulation steps use a lossless format ppm rle tiff etc while working on the image then jpeg it when you are ready to file it away aside from avoiding degradation you will save a lot of compression decompression time this way what are some rules of thumb for converting gif images to jpeg as stated earlier you will lose some amount of image information if you convert an existing gif image to jpeg if you can obtain the original full color data the gif was made from it s far better to make a jpeg from that but if you need to save space and have only the gif to work from here are some suggestions for getting maximum space savings with minimum loss of quality the first rule when converting a gif library is to look at each jpeg to make sure you are happy with it before throwing away the corresponding gif that will give you a chance to re do the conversion with a higher quality setting if necessary some gifs may be better left as gifs as explained in section in particular cartoon type gifs with sixteen or fewer colors don t convert well you may find that a jpeg file of reasonable quality will be larger than the gif so check the sizes too experience to date suggests that large high visual quality gifs are the best candidates for conversion to jpeg they chew up the most storage so offer the most potential savings and they convert to jpeg with least degradation don t waste your time converting any gif much under kbytes also don t expect jpeg files converted from gifs to be as small as those created directly from full color originals to maintain image quality you may have to let the converted files be as much as twice as big as straight through jpeg files would be i e shoot for or rd the size of the gif file not th as suggested in earlier comparisons many people have developed an odd habit of putting a large constant color border around a gif image while useless this was nearly free in terms of storage cost in gif files it is not free in jpeg files and the sharp border boundary can create visible artifacts ghost edges do yourself a favor and crop off any border before jpeging if you are on an x windows system xv s manual and automatic cropping functions are a very painless way to do this cjpeg s default q setting of is appropriate for full color input but for gif inputs q settings of to often seem to be necessary to avoid image degradation if you apply smoothing as suggested below the higher q setting may not be necessary color gifs of photographs or complex artwork are usually dithered to fool your eye into seeing more than the colors that gif can actually store if you enlarge the image you will see that adjacent pixels are often of significantly different colors at normal size the eye averages these pixels together to produce the illusion of an intermediate color value the trouble with dithering is that to jpeg it looks like high spatial frequency color noise and jpeg can t compress noise very well the resulting jpeg file is both larger and of lower image quality than what you would have gotten from jpeging the original full color image if you had it to get around this you want to smooth the gif image before compression smoothing averages together nearby pixels thus approximating the color that you thought you saw anyway and in the process getting rid of the rapid color changes that give jpeg trouble appropriate use of smoothing will often let you avoid using a high q factor thus further reducing the size of the compressed file while still obtaining a better looking output image than you d get without smoothing with the v free jpeg software or products based on it a simple smoothing capability is built in try smooth or so when converting gifs values of to seem to work well for high quality gifs heavy handed dithering may require larger smoothing factors if you can see regular fine scale patterns on the gif image even without enlargement then strong smoothing is definitely called for too large a smoothing factor will blur the output image which you don t want if you are an image processing wizard you can also do smoothing with a separate filtering program such as pnmconvol from the pbmplus package however cjpeg s built in smoother is a lot faster than pnmconvol the upshot of all this is that cjpeg quality smooth is probably a good starting point for converting gifs but if you really care about the image you ll want to check the results and maybe try a few other settings for more information about jpeg in general or the free

boat but it could be anything on the drawing you have a set of reference points whose true x y positions are known now you digitize the drawing manually in this case using yaron danon s excellent digitize program that is you use a program which converts cursor positions to x y and saves those values when you click the mouse upon digitizing you notice that the reference point values that come out of the digitizing process differ in small but significant ways from the known true values this is understandable because the scanned drawing is a reproduction of the original and there are successive sources of distortion such as differential expansion and contraction of paper errors introduced in the printing process scanner errors and what have you the errors are not uniform over the entire drawing so global adjustments such as stretching contracting uniformly over x or y or rotating the whole drawing are not satisfactory so the question is does any kind soul know of an algorithm for removing such distortion in particular if i have three sets of points reference x y the known true values distortedreference x y the same points with known errors distorteddata x y other points with unknown errors what function of reference and distorted could i apply to distorteddata to remove the errors i suspect the problem could be solved by treating the distorted reference points as resulting from the projection of a bumpy d surface solving for the surface and then flattening it to remove the errors in the other data points it helps to have some idea of the source of the distortion or at least a reasonable model of the class of distortion below is a very short description of the process which we use if you have further questions feel free to poke me via e mail assume locally smooth distortion compute the delaunay triangulation of your x y points this defines the set of neighbors for each point if your data are not naturally convex you may have very long edges on the convex hull consider deleting these edges now there are two goals a move the distorteddata x y to the reference x y b keep the length e as measured from the current x y s as close as possible to the digitizedlength e as measured using the digitized x y s for every point compute a displacement based on a and b for example a for x y points for which you know the reference x y you can move alpha reference x y current x y this will slowly move the distortedreference x y towards the reference x y b for all other points examine the current length of each edge for each edge compute a displacement which would make that edge the correct length where correct is the digitizedlength take the vector sum of these edge displacements and move the point alpha sumofedgedisplacements this will keep the triangulated mesh consistent with your digitized mesh iterate until you are happy for example no point moves very much alpha and alpha need to be determined by experimentation consider how much you believe the reference x y i e do you absolutely insist on the final points exactly matching the references or do you want to balance some error in matching the reference against changes in length of the edges warning there are a couple of geometric invariants which must be observed essentially you can t allow the convex hull to change and you can t allow triangles to fold over neighboring triangles both of these can be handled either by special case checks on the motion of individual points or by periodically re triangulating the points using the current positions but still calculating digitizedlength from the original positions when we first did this the triangulation time was prohibitive so we only did it once if i were motivated to try and change code that has been working in production mode for years i might go back and re triangulate on every iteration if you have more compute power than you know what to do with you might consider having every point interact with every other point but first read up on linear solutions to the n body problem there are lots of papers in the last years of siggraph proceedings on springs constraints and energy calculations which are

2224###comp.graphics###outlining of spline surface about a year ago i started work on a problem that appeared to be very simple and turned out to be quite difficult i am wondering if anyone on the net has seen this problem and hopefully some published solutions to it the problem is to draw an outline of a surface defined by two roughly parallel cubic splines for inputs the problem essentially starts with two sets of points where each set of points is on the edge of an object which we treat as two dimensional i e only extant between the edges but which exists in three dimensional space to draw the object we fit a cubic spline through the points each spline is effectively computed as a sequence of line segments approximating the curve each spline has an equal number of segments we assume that the nth segment along each spline is roughly but not exactly the same distance along each spline by any reasonable measure take each segment n along each spline and match it to the nth segment of the opposing spline use the pair of segments to form two triangles which will be filled in to color the surface depth sort the triangles take each triangle in sorted order project onto a d pixmap draw and color the triangle take the edge of the triangle that is along the edge of the surface and draw a line along that edge colored with a special edge color it is the edge coloring in step that is at the heart of the problem the idea is to effectively outline the edge of the surface the net result however generally has lots of breaks and gaps in the edge of the surface the reasons for this are fairly complicated they involve both rasterization problems and problems resulting from the projecting the splines if anything about this problem sounds familiar we would appreciate knowing about other work in this area thanks

distributing original artwork and photographs over the network for public perusal scrutiny and distribution digital immortality the basic idea behind digital immortality is that computer networks are here to stay and that anything interesting you deposit on them will be around near forever the gifs and jpgs of today will be the artifacts of a digital future perhaps they ll be put in different formats perhaps only surviving on backup tapes but they ll be there and someone will dig them up if that doesn t interest you otis also offers a forum for critique and exhibition of your works a virtual art gallery that never closes and exists in an information dimension where your submissions will hang as wallpaper on thousands of glowing monitors suddenly life is breathed into your work and by merit of it s stimulus it will travel the globe on pulses of light and electrons spectators are welcome also feel free to browse the gallery and let the artists know what you think of their efforts keep your own copies of the images to look at when you ve got the gumption that s what they re here for where otis currently as of has two ftp sites projects otis the uwi site sunsite unc edu pub multimedia pictures otis the sunsite you can also gopher to this site for otis as well merely anonymous ftp to either site on internet and change to the appropriate directory don t forget to get busy and use the bin command to make sure you re in binary otis has also been spreading to some dial up bbs systems around north america the following systems have a substancial supply of otistuff underground cafe omaha lines cyberden sanfran usenet waffle iron how do you contribute what happens is you draw a pretty picture or take a lovely photo get it scanned into an image file then either ftp put it in the contrib incoming directory or use uuencode to send it to me email addresses at eof in email after the image is received it will be put into the correct directory computer originated works are also welcome otis directories house two types of image files gif and jpg gif and jpg files require oddly enough a gif or jpg viewer to see these viewers are available for all types of computers at most large ftp sites around internet jpg viewers are a bit tougher to find if you can t find one but do have a gif viewer you can obtain a jpg to gif conversion program which will change jpg files to a standard gif format otis also accepts animation files when you submit image files please send me email at the same time stating information about what you uploaded and whether it is to be used in publications or other projects or if it is merely for people to view also include some biographical information on yourself we ll be having info files on each contributing artist and their works you can also just upload a text file of info about yourself instead of emailing if you have pictures but no scanner there is hope merely send copies to the otis project c o ed stastny po bx omaha ne i will either scan them myself or get them to someone who will scan them include an ample sase if you want your stuff back also include information on each image preferably a line description of the image that we can include in the infofile in the directory where it s finally put if you have preferences as to what the images are to be named include those as well conversely if you have a scanner and would like to help out please contact me and we ll arrange things if you want to submit your works by disk peachy merely send a disk to the above address omaha and a sase if you want your disk back this is good for people who don t have direct access to encoders or ftp but do have access to a scanner we accept disks in either mac or ibm compatible format if possible please submit image files as gif or jpg if you can t we can convert from most formats we d just rather not have to at senders request we can also fill disks with as much otis as they can stand even if you don t have stuff to contribute you can send a blank disk and an sase or for disk postage and packing to get a slab o otis as of we re at about megabytes of files and growing email me for current archive size and directory distribution the images distributed by the otis project may be distributed freely on the condition that the original filename is kept and that it is not altered in any way save to convert from one image format to another in fact we encourage files to be distributed to local bulletin boards and such if you could please transport the appropriate text files along with the images it would also be nice if you d send me a note when you did post images from otis to your local bbs i just want to keep track of them so participants can have some idea how widespread their stuff is it s the purpose of otis to get these images spread out as much as possible if you have the time please upload a few to your favorite bbs system or even just post this info file there it would be keen of you use if you want to use any of the works you find on the otis directory you ll have to check to see if permission has been granted and the stipulations of the permission such as free copy of publication or full address credit you will either find this in the rm file for the image or series of images or in the artists directory under the artists name if permission isn t explicitly given then you ll have to contact the artist to ask for it if no info is available email me ed cwis unomaha edu and i ll get in contact with the artist for you or give you their contact information when you do use permitted work it s always courteous to let the artist know about it perhaps even send them a free copy or some such compensation for their files naming images please keep the names of your files in dos format that means keep the filename before jpg or gif to eight characters or less the way i usually do it is to use the initials of the artist plus a three or four digit code for the series of images plus the series number thus leonardo devinci s fifth mechanical drawing would be something like ldmek gif or ldmek jpg or ldmech gif etc keeping the names under characters assures that the filename will remain intact on all systems creating image files when creating image files be sure to at least include your name somewhere on or below the picture this gives people a reference in case they d like to contact you you may also want to include a title address or other information you d like people to know hmmm that s about it for now more guidelines will be added as needed your input is expected disclaimer the otis project has no connection to the church of otis a sumerian deity or it s followers be they pope priest or ezine administrator we do take sacrifices and donations however disclaimer the otis project is here for the distribution of original image files the files will go to the public at large it s possible as with any form of mass media that someone could unscrupulously use your images for financial gain unless you ve given permission for that it s illegal otis takes no responsibility for this in simple terms all rights revert to the author artist to leave an image on otis is to give permission for it to be viewed copied and distributed electronically if you don t want your images distributed all over don t upload them to leave an image on otis is

2490###comp.graphics###advice sought turning font outlines into renderable polygons i am seeking some alternate solutions on how to turn a postscript type or truetype font outline into polygons that can be subsequently scan converted by a d scanline renderer i have been studying the problem of font conversion for a few years but have never had the need to implement such a system well i now have the opportunity to write some font rendering software so i would like to have some of my questions answered before i jump into the deep end the main problem i face is how to use the even odd or non winding rules to turn the outlines into a single outline polygon my renderer can handle complex polygons so there is no need to reduce the polygons to simple polygons for example in the letter o there are two outlines the outside outline which is clockwise truetype font the inside outline which is counterclockwise one common solution used by a number of rendering packages is to simply connect the inner outline to the outer outline at the point where the two outlines are closest this is equivalent to descibing a polygon with holes the renderer will then make the appropriate hole since the interior polygon edges are in the opposite direction to the outside edges i do not want to use this simplistic system since it will not handle all outline fonts properly it is not a simple matter to connect the outer outline to the inner outline for some fancy fonts it does not properly handle the even odd or non winding rules from my research over the years the proper solution is to use a trapezoid decomposition algorithm to scan convert the outlines into trapezoids as is done by the postscript and truetype font rasterizers these trapezoidal polygons can then be easily and properly rendered by the d scanline renderer my question is are there any better solutions to turning the outlines into polgyons other than the trapezoid decomposer i am not fond of this solution since it creates excess number of polygons another question for those in the know what is the best algorithm to create bevelled and or offset curves for font outlines i have a dozen papers on these subjects but i can t tell which method is the best to implement thanks for any pointers rob lansdale robert lansdale dynamic graphics project internet lansd dgp toronto edu computer systems research institute uucp uunet dgp toronto edu lansd university of toronto bitnet lansd dgp utoronto toronto ontario m s a canada

about three weeks ago i took a long cool ride on the hawk down to cycles for a test ride they had sold and delivered the demo st about fifteen hours before i arrived and the demo vfr was bike locked in the showroom surrounded by other bikes and not likely to move soon today was different there were even more bikes used dirt bikes used street bikes cars and a big tent full of outlandishly fat touring bikes with trailers were all squeezed in the parking lot some sort of fat bike convention shelly and dave were running one msf course each at the same time one in the classroom and one on the back lot plus there was the usuall free cookout food that cycles gives away every weekend in the summer hmmm it seemed like a big moto party after about ten minutes of looking for rob c cheif of sales slime and another minutes reading and signing a long disclosure libility pray to god form i helped jt push the st out into the mess in the parking lot we went over the the controls i put the tank bag from the hawk into the right saddlebag and my wife put everything else into the left saddlebag thats nice having helped push the st out to the lot i thought it best to have jt move it to the edge of the road away from the bikes and people he rode it like a bicycle it cant be that heavy i thought well i was wrong as i sat on the st both feet down all i could think was big then i put one foot up heavy came to mind very quickly with cindy on the back was she on the back hard to tell with seat three times as large as a hawk seat the bike seemed nearly out of control just idling on the side of the road by rpm in second gear all the weight seemed to dissappear even on bike with miles on the odometer slippery new tires and pads that did not yet bite the disks things seems smooth and sure cycles is on a section of that few folks ever ride about miles north of the computer concentration about five miles north of where i splits away is a lighly travelled two lane limited access highway it goes through heavily forested sections of hamilton manchester by the sea and newbury on its way to gloucester on its way there it meets a road that winds from the sea about miles inland to andover on its way it goes through many thoroughly new england spots perfect if slow sport touring sections cindy has no difficulty with speed rd gear th gear purring along in top gear this thing has less low rpm grunt that my hawk lane changes were a new experience a big heft is required to move this thing responds well though no wallowing or complaint behind the fairing it was fairly quiet but the helmet buffeting was non trivial top gear car passing at mph was nearly effortless smooth smooth smooth not sure what the v sound reminds me of but it is pleasant if only the bars were not transmitting an endless buzz the jump on to caused me to be less than impressed with the brakes its a down hill reversing camber twice reversing radius decreasing radius turn a real squeeze is needed on the front binder the section of we were on was tight but too urban the st works ok in this section but it shows its weight we went by the clam shack oft featured in spencer for hire a place where you could really find spencer his house was about miles down after putting through traffic for a while we turned and went back to about half way through the onramp i yanked cindy s wrist our singal for hold on tight head check left time to find redline second gear gives a good shove third too fourth sees dod speed with a short shift into top on the way to we saw no cops and very light traffic did not cross into dod zone because the bike was too new well now it had miles on it so it was ok tried some high effort lane changes some wide sweeping turns time to wick it up i went until the buffeting was threating to pull us off the seat and stayed there when i was comfortable with the wind and the steering i looked down to find an indicated mph not bad for up touring beverly comes fast at more than twice the posted limit at the get off in a mile sign i rolled off the throttle and coasted i wanted to re adjust to the coming slowness it was a good idea there were several manhole sized patches of sand on the exit ramp back to the slow and heavy behavior cycles is about a mile from i could see even more cars stacked up outside right when i got off i managed to thread the st through the cars to the edge of the concrete pad out front heavy it took way too much effort for cindy and i to put the thing on the center stand i am sure that if i used the side stand the st would have been on its side

3982###sci.electronics###grounding power wiring was re a question about vac outlet wiring there has been quite a bit of discussion about house wiring and grounding practices here a few points need to be clarified the equipment grounding conductor green green with a yellow stripe bare or the metal sheath or pipe of some wiring methods is used as a safety ground to carry fault currents back to the circuit breaker panel and to limit the voltage on the metal case of utilization equipment or other metal objects it should never except for a few exceptions to be discussed later carry the normal operating current of a connected load some equipment has filters in the power supply which may cause some slight current flow through the grounding conductor much communications or audio equipment is sensitive to noise or slight voltages on the grounding conductor and may require special wiring of the grounding conductors to provide reliable operation orange outlets are often used for this with insulated grounding conductors wired back to the panel box and in many cases back to the service anyone installing such a system should read both the section on grounding in the national electric code and publications on installing quiet isolated ground systems the code requires the insulated grounding conductors green wires to run with the current carrying conductors back to the panel box and if required back all the way to the service entrance where it is bonded to the service ground water pipe or rod many of these systems are installed illegally or unsafely where they do not provide a safe ground or a quiet ground or either the grounded conductor of a circuit often called the neutral which is referred to in the code as the identified conductor and is supposed to be white or natural grey this conductor is supposed to be connected to ground in most electrical systems at a single point generally at the service entrance panel this connection is through the main bonding jumper in many household service panels the main bonding jumper is actually a bonding screw which attaches the neutral busbar to the case of the panel the grounded conductor neutral is generally a current carrying conductor in the case of a volt circuit it is one of the two conductors completing the circuit from the panel to the load device since the grounded conductor neutral is only connected to the grounding conductor bare or green at the service entrance if the load is any distance from the service and draws any significant current there will be a small but measurable voltage between the grounded and grounding conductors at the load under normal operating conditions if you should incorrectly connect the grounded neutral conductor to the grounding conductor at the load some of the neutral current will flow instead through the grounding conductor since there will now be current flowing through the grounding conductor it will also no longer be quite at ground potential at the load end if the load equipment has a metal case which is connected to the grounding conductor through the u ground plug the metal case is now also no longer quite at ground potential the difference under normal non short circuit conditions may be only a few tenths of a volt but it could also be a volt or two this normally does not present a shock hazard however if you let the metal case of the grounded equipment come into contact with an independently grounded object such as a water or gas pipe a radiator a metal air conditioning duct or such part of the neutral current will try to flow through this aalternate ground path if the contact is not solid you will get a significant arc a low voltage but possibly moderate current arc under the wrong conditions this arcing could start a fire it is possible in some cases that the sneak ground current could also flow through a wire of inadequate size causing it to overheat with the incorrect non single point grounding of the neutral if there is a short circuit from hot to neutral the high short circuit current which may flow will cause a much higher voltage on the grounding conductor which increases the possibility for shock or fire also if you incorrectly multiply connect the neutral and ground the voltage on the ground system is seen as noise bu computer or audio equipment often causing malfunction i have spent some hours tracking down such shorts in technical facilities where they were inducing severe hum into equipment the neutral is usually bonded to the ground at the distribution transformer as well as at the service entrance of each dwelling this is done primarily for lightning protection so that induced lightning currents have a short path back to ground and also to assure that the currents drawn by shorts to grounded objects like pipes draw enough current to trip circuit breakers or blow fuses quickly the bad side of this is that not all the neutral current from the dwelling goes through the neutral wire back to the transformer some of it flows through the grounding electrode water pipe etc this may cause corrosion in the pipes and possibly in things like underground fuel oil tanks and it may also cause measurable ac magnetic fields due to the large loop between the hot conductors in the service and the neutral current in the water pipe and ground there are those who feel these fields may be unhealthy don t flame me on this i m just telling you where the field comes from not it s health effect as far as i m concerned the jury is still out on this note that the bonding jumper is only installed at the main panel not at any sub distribution panels this is one reason why it is illegal to run service entrance cable with the sheath used as a neutral to a sub panel you must have a seperate insulated conductor for the neutral the sheath can be used in this application only as the grounding conductor if the neutral is bonded to the grounding conductor in the sub panel say by forgetting to remove the bonding screw all the grounding conductors of the loads on that panel will be above ground with the possible problems listed above the code makes exceptions for ranges and dryers as well as feeds from one building to another in the cases of the range and dryer the neutral may be used as the equipment ground under certain conditions instead of a seperate wire every time the code is revised these exceptions come up for review these exceptions were in fact the first required safety grounds in the days before u ground outlets and such the appliance manufacturers don t want to have to redesign their ranges and driers and the contractors don t want to have to run four wire cable with four fairly heavy expensive wires in place of three wire to the appliances no question it would be safer with seperate neutrals to the stove but the neutral current is low for most burner settings since most current is in the volt hots except at some low settings the wires are large gauge and there are few reported cases of injury or damage so far the exceptions have survived in the case of feeds between buildings it s primarily for lightning protection people doing wiring should be aware what is and what isn t a legal grounding conductor obviously the bare wire in romex with ground is anywhere there is a green wire installed such as in a portable cord that is a good grounding conductor the sheath of bx clamped in bx connectors in metal boxes is a legal grounding conductor in the us bx has an aluminum band run under the steel sheath to lower the resistance of the sheath you can just cut this aluminum band off at the ends you don t have to bond it to anything it does its job by touching every turn of the bx sheath conduit or emt thinwall tubing is generally a legal grounding conductor but may require a bonding locknut where it enters a box or panel particularly for larger pipes greenfield looks like big bx but you pull your own wires in the empty sheath after you run it is not a legal grounding conductor as it doesn t have the aluminum band to bond it and the spiral steel has too much resistance and inductance you have to run a seperate green grounding conductor inside the greenfield wiremold is also not a legal grounding conductor as the paint on the boxes often prevents good contact and the feed to the wiremold extension is often from a box in the wall that may not be well connected to the first wiremold box i have personally discovered cases where the entire run of wiremold and the cases of everything plugged into all the outlets on the run were hot with volts why do i get a shock every time i touch my computer and the radiator here in the office because there was no ground wire in the wiremold and one of the outlets had shorted to the edge of the wiremold box you must run a ground wire back in the wiremold from the outlets at least to the first box in the original wiring conduit bx etc where you can bond the wire to the box with a screw bnding clip or whatever on another issue while you should ground the green wire lug on gcfi outlets when ever there is a place to ground them it is legal in the nec to use them without a ground if no ground is available it is better to have the protection of the ground fault interrupter than no protection if you don t install it the interrupter doesn t depend on the ground to trip it is desirable to connect the ground if available because if the ground is connected the interrupter will trip as soon as a faulty device is plugged in whereas without the ground it will not trip until someone or something provides a ground path for those questioning the legal use of ungrounded gcfi s read in the nec d exception this is the code my code is in the city but i know the rule hasn t

4039###sci.electronics###re what do nuclear site s cooling towers do nagle netcom com john nagle writes great explaination however you left off one detail why do you always see them at nuclear plants but not always at fossil fuel plants at nuclear plants it is prefered to run the water closed cycle whereas fossil fuel plants can in some cases get away with dumping the hot water as i recall the water isn t as hot thermodynamically in many fossil fuel plants and of course there is less danger of radioactive contamination actually the reasons you don t see so many cooling towers at fossil plants are fossil units multiple units per plant are generally smaller than nuclear plants mwe seemed to be a very popular size when many fossil plants were built the average nuclear plant is mwe many fossil plants were grandfathered when water discharge regulations were adopted why those old dirt burners can t harm anything let em go powered draft cooling towers low enough to the ground to be generally not visible from off site are quite popular with fossil plants fossil plants used to get much less regulatory attention than nuclears actually fossil fuel plants run hotter than the usual boiling water reactor nuclear plants there s a gripe in the industry that nuclear power uses vintage steam technology so it s more important in nuclear plants to get the cold end of the system as cold as possible hence big cooling towers oil and gas fired steam plants also have condensers but they usually are sized to get the steam back into hot water not most of the way down to ambient some plants do cool the condensers with water rather than air as one canadian official asked about thermal pollution de icing a river said up here we view heat as a resource actually the condensing environment is essentially the same for plants of similar size the issues are the same regardless of where the heat comes from condensers are run at as high a vacuum as possible in order to reduce aerodynamic drag on the turbine the condenser pressure is normally water s vapor pressure at the condensing temperature it is desirable that the steam exhaust be free of water droplets because moisture in the steam causes severe erosion damage to the turbine low pressure blades and because entrained water moving at high velocity causes erosion of the condenser tubes the coldest and thus lowest pressure condensing environment is always the best a related issue is that of pumping the condensate from the hotwell where the water ends up after dripping off the condenser tubes since the condenser is at a very low pressure the only force driving the condensate into the hotwell pumps is gravity if the condensate is too hot or the gravity head is too low the condensate will reflash into steam bubbles and cause the condensate pumps to cavitate this is a particularly destructive form of cavitation that is to be avoided at all costs the hotwell pumps are located in the lowest point in the plant in order to provide a gravity head to the pumps how much lower they must be is a function of how hot the water is allowed to get in the hotwell typically hotwell temperatures run between and degrees depending on the temperature of the river water this term is used to describe the river grade water even when the cooling tower system is operating in closed loop mode and essentially no river water is pumped when the river water temperature is high in the summer operators will typically allow the hotwell level to rise in order to provide more gravity head there is a tradeoff involved since higher hotwell levels will encroach onto the condensing tubes and reduce the condenser area at least in the east and elsewhere where moisture actually exists in the air the river water will almost always be cooler than the discharge water from the cooling towers the temperature of the discharge water from the cooling towers is set by the ambient air temperature and humidity it is very rare in the east to hear of actual river water temperatures exceeding degrees a vast difference from the typical days degrees humidity we see routinely in the east it is not unusual particularly where the econazis have been successful in clamping rigid discharge water temperature limits on a plant for the plant to have to reduce the firing rate when the air temperature gets too high and the condenser cannot handle the heat load without excessive pressure everybody runs closed cycle boilers the water used is purified of solids which otherwise crud up the boiler plumbing when the water boils purifying water for boiler use is a bigger job than cooling it so the boiler water is recycled true actually secondary plant the part that makes electricity and feeds feedwater to the boiler water chemistry has been the bastard stepchild until recently and has not gotten the respect it deserves the plant chemists have just in the past decade or so fully understood the costs of impure water by impure i mean water with

writes deleted and as far as fully automatic weapons you can be a lot better armed if you want to hit what you aim at what seems to be happening here is the situation getting totally blown out of proportion in my post i was referring to your regular patrolman in a car cruising around the city vs gang members of course the police have access to the things that you mentioned but do they use tanks and such all of the time of course they don t and that s the point i was trying to make every day when i go out to lunch i always see cops coming in the majority that i see are still carrying revolvers not that there is anything wrong with a revolver but if you re a cop that is up against some gang member with a couple of automatics in his coat i mean semi auto handguns you re going to be at a disadvantage even with training i have been at a shooting range where gang gang members were practicing shooting they were actually practicing taking out their guns as quick as possible and shooting at the target and they weren t doing too badly either the university cops here who are are state cops are armed better than the chicago police it seems most state cops are every city and suburban police officer i ve seen around the twin cities in the last two years has carried a semi auto of some type different brands though i haven t seen any glock s with regard to this discussion we are getting dangerously far from the usual rantings of t p g and close to the realm of r g but i d like to put my two cents worth in while there s nothing wrong with a revolver especially a large frame s w in magnum my favorite there are valid advantages to semi autos i suggest reading massad ayoob s i know some people can t stand him and think he s full of bull but i think that in general his material is very valid and useful book the semi auto pistol in police work or something like that he defines a number of ways that semi auto s are different and that different is good the main advantage is not in increased firepower but in more accurate followup shots when you go to single action mode there is also a certain propriatory nature of each gun that takes some familiarity to learn this may have diminished with time as more criminals become familiar with different models of semi autos but it was cited as stopping or at least slowing down criminals who had grabbed a police officers gun define armed better go shoot a revolver and a semi auto like the colt does one fires faster than the other nope aside from which faster rate of fire is usually not desirable sure it makes the other guys duck for cover but just you trying hitting anything with a thompson in hose mode this is why the military is limiting it s m now to round burst fire simple semi auto would be better but the troops like to be able to rock and roll even if it is wasteful of ammo something often in short supply when the enemy is plentiful a revolver is equally capable as a semi auto in the same caliber a revolver also has the advantage that if it misfires you just pull the trigger again a double action revolver almost all of them can be hand cocked first but will fire merely by pulling the trigger yes but this is best done with a two hand hold with a single hand you either pull the gun far off target to cock or must fire double action the da semi auto has the same advantages plus is always sa after the first shot a misfire in a revolver merely means you must pull the trigger again to rotate to the next round i m not sure if this is meant to be different from your first point in a da semi auto you can pull the trigger again to try dropping the hammer on the same round an advantage you don t have in a revolver where the next trigger pull will always go to the next round discussing this point now this is fine with a dud but what about a hangfire situation granted it s very rare but your round will now go off confined in the cylinder with no place to go slingshotting the slide on a misfire takes very little time a revolver can be carried with the th chamber empty and under the hammer for maximum safety but still can be drawn and fired with an easy motion even one handed actually with modern revolver designs incorporating hammer blocks this is not necessary or usually recommended a revolver would have to fall hard enough and at the right angle to actually break the hammer and driver the firing pin into the round to set it off speedloaders for a revolver allow reloads almost as fast as magazines on semi autos can be faster depending on users the best speedloader users especially those using the spring loaded speed loaders are very fast a problem is that ejecting the spent cases is a two handed job where dropping the expended magazine is one handed this means that while you can be inserting a fresh magazine as soon as the old one clears the gun with a speed loader you have to go through more motions that will always take more time you also don t have the advantage of tactical reloads replacing a partial magazine to bring you back to full capacity the partial magazine can still be used if needed later a misfire in a semi auto will require you to clear a jammed shell first time spent which can be fatal and a vital second or so is often lost as you realize hey it s jammed before starting to do anything about clearing it yes the time to recognize the problem is just as important as the time to clear it really though in either a revolver or semi auto the odds of an actual misfire with factory ammo are awfully small you are more likely to get a jam in a semi auto but even these are exceptionally rare with modern quality guns sigs glocks et al most semi autos must have the slide worked to chamber the first round and cock the hammer some police carry their semi autos with the chamber loaded and hammer cocked but a safety engaged i do not consider this safe however you must trade off safety to get the same speed of employment as a revolver there are some double action semi autos out there but the complexity of operation of many of them requires more training all common semi auto s can be carried with a round in their chamber without any safety problems while i put that out as a statement that i believe i should say that this applies to all of the ones i ve looked at for the da semi s it s no different from the revolver situation the guns all have hammer or firing pin blocks they also have a safety because there s no real advantage carrying one of these cocked and locked you have the same safety and speed of employment as a revolver plus the advantage of sa followup shots i m not familiar with sa semi autos except for the a i admit that i was initially skeptical about carrying this cocked and locked but after examining the design trying to defeat the safeties gun unloaded of course and shooting it a lot i see no inherent safety problems with it especially in a thumbreak holster with the strap under the hammer this design also gets you more speed for an accurate first shot than a revolver some police departments switched to glocks and then started quietly switching many officers back to the old revolvers too many were having accidents partly due to the poor training they received not that glocks require rocket scientists but some cops are baffled by something as complex as the timer on a vcr yeah the infamous glock i still can t figure out how it s worse than a revolver for safety if you don t pull the trigger it doesn t go off i imagine that if all your revolver shooting was done double action then you could pull the glock trigger far enough to fire before you realized it in addition if you had developed that nasty habit of keeping your finger on the trigger when holstering your gun and relying on your thumb on the hammer to remind you to take it off before you blew off your foot then you d have problems when the hammer wasn t there anyone who goes anyone saying that the criminals obviously outgun the police don t know nothing about firearms turn off cops and hunter and pay attention i do not seek here to say semi autos are junk merely that assuming they are better for all jobs is stupid a cop with a revolver on his hip and a shotgun in the rack is more than equipped for anything short of a riot i think this is even okay for a riot as long as it s a small one b gun control is hitting what you aim at if you whip out a wonder nine and fire real fast you may find you don t hit anything good controlled fire from a revolver is more likely to get you a hit i own a mm beretta myself but consider it inferior as a carry weapon to something like the ruger security six revolver if i haven t hit what i m aiming at in the first shots something is quite seriously wrong somewheres while i might like having the backup capacity of those extra shots in certain cases overwhelmingly the of shots fired in criminal encounters is less than i have the poor man s beretta taurus and consider it inferior as a carry weapon to the springfield oops mm vs arguments are relegated to r g you are right though if you don t hit what you aim at then the shooter gun combination has failed i don t ascribe failures in the the fire real fast with a wonder nine scenario you mention to the gun this is a shooter failure whether through lack of discipline or lack of training what do crooks overwhelmingly use in crime why the same nice simple revolvers that the police often use well actually some police prefer the much heftier magnum but anyway mm s are becoming more popular with crooks too though the does still lead the list and like i said around here semi auto s seem the rule for the street cop don t know about the state patrol however they may still carry the highway patrolman obplea don t flame me i prefer semi autos for most things but they introduce unneccessary complications to something as nerve wracking as an abrupt encounter with a lone criminal vincent please don t take any of this as a flame just my whoops looks more like worth and much of it is imho but do check ayoob s book if everything had gone as planned everything would have been perfect batf spokesperson

acquiring weapons in norway you can buy almost all kinds of weapons in norway but you must have a permit and a good reason to get the permit if i would like to have a handgun i would have to get an gun licence from the police and to be a member of a gun club the primary objection beyond ones based on the ideal of rkba that it is simply not something the government should do is that it makes guns a play thing and tool of the rich and connected it discriminates against the poor is self defense considered appropriate and if so under what conditions are you allowed for instance to get a gun for protection if you re going to be carrying a very large sum of money on a regular basis or have been threatened the police would check my criminal records for any serious crimes and or records of serious mental diseases this has been suggested in the u s and generally supported among gun owners what many object to is that many if not most proposals contain a sort of gotcha clause which allows an arbitrary denial even if you qualify in every way now if a got my licence i would have to be an active member of the gun club for months before i could collect my gun it s a little like getting a drivers licence isn t it you have to prove that you can drive before you are allowed to at this point it should be pointed out that in general a driver s licence in the u s is for the most part nothing like its european counterpart i understand getting one is far more difficult there than here in the u s it s a joke but my usual objection is that you re discussing two different things for instance in the u s a driver s license is a permit to operate a motor vehicle on a public road it is not necessary to own one or to operate it on private property that is the ability to require driving permits is generally considered to arise from the government s legitimate power to enact reasonable regulations for behavior on public lands a permit to own an automobile for instance which is far closer an analogy would be a much harder thing to get past legally since it wouldn t be based on making regulations on public property but in restricting activity on private property use of guns in crimes in norway some crimes are commited with guns that have been in the owners arms for a long time but these are rather the exeption most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes and mostly short time befor the crime use of knives it is allowed to cary knifes in public but not in your belt or open you americans think it s ok to have a gun but not to carry it open in public rigth this varies widely one thing i think europeans have a difficult time with is that the u s has fifty unique jurisdictions where the laws from one state to another can be as radically different as from one country in europe to another some places allow open carry of both guns and knives some allow concealed some prohibit both or allow one or the other and it can be either a state or local restriciton individual vs masses yes the individual is more important than the masses but only to some extent your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses what happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of all the others the question must be asked is the right of this individual affecting the rights of this other individual what we usually get is that the rights of this group meaning some individuals within this group here defined as people who own guns are adversely affecting the rights of some other group if for instance bob were using his gun to attack steve you d have a point but essentially what we re discussing is that becuase some person who qualifies as a member of the group people who own guns then some third person perhaps in another time zone is told that their being a member of that group is taking away somebody else s rights it s like trying to punish all newspapers for the libel commited by one the issue i believe the issue is guns and gun legislation the issue is crime violence and murder the question is to what extent guns and gun legislation impact those we shouldn t mix weapons and items that can serve as one if i lived in amerika i would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in home but should it have to be like that of course not it would be nice if we didn t have to fear that other people might get it into their twisted little minds to hurt us but currently we don t have that option nor do i expect we will do you think it s wise to sell guns like candy some states do no state does in any case there s a limit to which the state may enforce it s wisdom on me freedom in general is an unwise concept if you pre emptively restrict everything which might be unwise then freedom becomes a meaningless concept if you believe it s smart neccacery to have drivers licence why do you think it should be free to buy guns i ll raise my hand against driver s licenses as currently implemented they re a waste of time and little more than revanue generation for the state and ignored by a startling number of drivers it does not guarantee a level of skill any higher than is necessary to get your car on the road and get yourself or somebody else killed or a knowledge of traffic laws beyond what any ten year old will have picked up riding around in his parents car but as i mentioned they re two different things david veal univ of

get an gun licence from the police and to be a member of a gun club the police would check my criminal records for any serious crimes and or records of serious mental diseases now if a got my licence i would have to be an active member of the gun club for months before i could collect my gun so like what do you do during those six months to be active my town has a similar requirement and it s rather stupid before you can buy a handgun you have to be an active member of a gun club well how active can you be without a gun chief most gun owners feel a check of criminal records for crimes and mental disorders would be a very good thing if it couldn t be abused by the government but every time this is proposed there is always some trapdoor by which the government can deny your purchase even if you are perfectly qualified to own a gun and we oppose this it s a little like getting a drivers licence isn t it you have to prove that you can drive before you are allowed to since the fatal accident rate for licensed automobile drivers in the us is around times the fatal accident rate of largely unlicensed gun owners i d think twice before using this analogy besides the problem is criminal use of guns not accidents there are about criminal uses of guns in the us every year but only accidents i don t think it s necessary to spend a lot of energy making sure a criminal can shoot a gun before he gets one just like the check most gun owners feel positively about requiring safety courses if they couldn t be abused by the government but they already have one state doesn t hold the courses another doesn t fund them a third holds them only once a year with limited attendence to those with political connections is this fair most criminals accuire guns to use them in crimes and mostly short time befor the crime and how many of them acquire these guns from legal retail outlets how many are borrowed stolen smuggled bought on the black market use of knives it is allowed to cary knifes in public but not in your belt or open you americans think it s ok to have a gun but not to carry it open in public rigth some states allow only open carry some allow only concealed carry some allow both some allow both but require licenses for concealed carry all you can say is if one of these modes has a clear advantage over another in terms of reducing crime or any other public good then state legislators someplace are doing exactly the wrong thing which means that they really don t have any objective reasons for these laws other than their preferences a bad way to govern scandinavians are aggressive we northeners are not as hot livered as southeners but when we decide to take action we do hot livered i love that expression here we say hot headed individual vs masses yes the individual is more important than the masses but only to some extent your criminal laws are to protect the individuals who makes the masses what happens when the rigths of some individuals affects the rights of all the others typically the only criminals who can affect the rights of all the other people are criminals in government offices the rest of our criminals affect the rights of only one or a few people at a time and they do this during the commission of a crime possession of a gun by someone hurts no one else it is when they do something violent with that gun that the crime occurs of course it is a crime for a felon or ex felon to possess a gun but we don t feel it is right to treat common citizens who have lived good lives as if they were just pre felons waiting to commit crimes we shouldn t mix weapons and items that can serve as one i don t understand this sentence if i lived in amerika i would probably have a gun to defend myselfe in home but should it have

address what i have to do to live in this one do you think it s wise to sell guns like candy some states do none of ours i m sure if you believe it s smart neccacery to have drivers licence why do you

4521###talk.politics.guns###re long gun hearings day in massachusetts april this is a co authored report from two of us who were there gun owners action league our state rifle association started the day with a rally in the secluded courtyard behind the statehouse at it was looking sparse about people until the speaker began whereupon about more people followed the loudspeakers from wherever they had been lost and filled out the area something proud mike yacino of goal spoke one of his best throwaway lines was to remind us that all of us holders of carry permits there had been checked and certified clear of all crimes by the state while the people in the statehouse behind us only had to be certified clean of election fraud to hold their jobs nancy snow and amos hamburger were busy handing out id buttons and sheets describing all the bills to be presented at the hearings and telling people where to find their own representatives and in too many cases who they were mike warned us that the committee was going to suspend its rules and discuss a bill that hadn t made it onto the official list it seems a delegation of students from simon s rock of bard college alma mater of wayne lo who shot up the place with an sks late last year was being bussed in to testify for a bill to ban all sales of firearms or ammo to anyone who is not a state resident the hearings were originally scheduled in the large gardner auditorium at but that had been pre empted by the governor s hearings on the framingham eight women in prison for killing abusive husbands and seeking release so we had until to buttonhole our representatives after which we would be squashed into an inadequate hearing room one of my representatives staffers was somewhat offensively smarmy he said oh it must be gun hearings day again the gun lobby is always so organized every year i got a little pissed and replied i m not from the gun lobby i m from your district at your second reporter arrived in time to notice a demonstration going on in front of the statehouse where the pro gunners weren t randy price from the tv news was there in his mirror reflective shades talking to one of the anti gun types and several simon s rock anti gun close the loophole protestors earlier randy had covered the goal rally the room we had been assigned seated about remember there were about gun owners there plus another students and teachers from bard one of us had already reserved a seat the other never got closer than the atrium outside and there was a crowd behind him a cop took up station at the entrance and prevented the rest of the crowd from coming in soon after the debate started a loudspeaker was set up outside in the hall for the benefit of everyone else everyone who was there inside and outside got to sign up on a sheet saying what their position was on which bills most of us signed up to support goal s position on all bills first because of their time constraints public officials got to testify and first up was the bill that nobody had seen the students had some curfew i guess currently massachusetts law allows a non resident to purchase long guns or ammo from a local dealer provided he complies with the laws of his own state previously the law was similar but applied only to non residents from states adjoining massachusetts the simon s rock folks called the current law a loophole and wanted it closed two of their reps spoke about wayne lo and his sks assault rifle the second one hodgekiss a co sponsor had done his homework so well that he kept confusing montana wayne lo s home state with missouri and became belligerent when about five gun owners in the gallery corrected him after his second muff carr from gloucester claimed that the new bill would put the law back the way it was but he was lying the new bill allows purchases by non residents of adjoining states only if they have licensing in their own state as strong as that in massachusetts since none of them do that s that some of the things these two said were really offensive in some of these other states anyone can buy a gun as long as he s breathing oooooo we have some very very good gun laws in massachusetts if only the other states would adopt the same type of laws we wouldn t be having this situation but they won t naughty naughty next up was boston city councilman albert dapper o neill he was there to testify pro gun but in some ways he was a liability he s reasonably elderly and tends to wander and repeat himself plus he s almost a caricature of a law n order politician he badmouthed the aclu said violent criminals should be executed and that if he were judge he d give arrestees their last rights pun intended on the spot at which many of the gun owners applauded which bothered me he said that all the proposed gun restrictions were a step in the right direction for the criminals he said this four times two of the bills under consideration would allow police to rescind a ccw or fid and confiscate all your guns if someone had filed a restraining order against you note that the filing of a restraining order requires no warrant no hearing no evidence and no conviction just an accusation senator barrett of reading testified in favor of it and patronized the pro gunners there several times by saying i m sure all the gun owners here will agree with me that we have to get these weapons out of the hands of people that our courts have convicted i haven t seen such a disgustingly disingenuous performance since nixon whined that he wasn t a crook barrett also spoke in favor of the bill making the fid card renewable every five years instead of permanent as it is now the stated purpose is to remove fid cards from those who have become ineligible revenue has nothing to do with it yeah right apparently some congressmen think we re stupid enough to swallow the argument that it s preferable to process million renewals every cycle in the vague hope of catching a recent felon than to simply take the goddamn card away from a criminal at conviction time as usual hassle the law abiding instead of the crook the two co chairs of the committee were rep caron and sen jujuga jujuga didn t say much he was a co sponsor of both restraining order bills but caron struck me as a sharp guy that wouldn t let any bad logic or lies on the part of either side to go unchallenged he was a co sponsor of one of the restraining order bills as well one of the younger reps on the committee forgot his name was vociferously pro gun somewhat embarrassingly so his heart was in the right place but his arguments seemed to be confined to every year it s the same damn thing you come in here with this crap it s nice to have a friend on the committee but he could have been more effective at about it was clear that the hall jam couldn t continue someone came out of another meeting hall and yelled at the cop because the loudspeaker was disturbing their meeting so the loudspeaker was disconnected so they found a bigger hall upstairs one of us had to leave to catch his charter bus and so missed the public testimony the other got a seat this time caron began by talking about how he got his fid years ago left the state and then returned without notifying them of his address change he complained that the state record system was not up to date and that his pd back in his city of birth still thought he lived there great quote if you purchase a gun today it will not get into the state computer system until this was also an argument he used against the renewable fid card testimony was heard from several battered women one of whom had been attacked by some guy in his s who had an fid card because he got it when he was or thereabouts they used a lot of emotion and said how they were scared of these men a staffer of attorney general harshbarger testified in favor of this anti gun bill saying how restraining orders were granted last year and how these women needed to be protected caron noted that a restraining order was granted for days and then a hearing was held to determine whether the order would be extended to a year he asked whether she would be satisfied if the fid were revoked at the time of this hearing rather than after the initial issuance of the fid she gave some long rambling circumlocution in response then testimony against the bill was heard mike yacino who looks something like einstein got up and made the point that restraining orders were issued on too little evidence that judges like to issue restraining orders just to let things cool off no matter who they think is right man or woman and that the hearings for restraining orders are lightning sessions with little time to consider facts atty karen mcnutt spoke with him a few times during his testimony other pro gunners got up to testify one said he had had to file a restraining order against a tenant to clear her out and that she countered by filing one against him he noted that this would have allowed the state to confiscate his guns if the new bill became law one of the junior reps noted that this is america and we have to be certain that individual rights are respected senator jujuga reiterated this saying that people who abuse smaller people can go to hell as far as i care but we have to be careful about equating conviction with a restraining order point and match senator another pro gunner got up and testified that he didn t know his citizenship expired every years and that a driver s license was a privilege not a right like the right to keep and bear arms a third got up and said the problem was with the criminal justice system and argued in favor of a death penalty bill and public hangings senator jujuga said he had himself tried to get a death penalty bill passed and joking responded that he too favored public hangings the speaker then responded i ll make you a deal you get me the rope and i ll tie the noose next came public testimony on the simon s rock bill a teacher testified that she had been the teacher of wayne lo and that he wouldn t have been able to shoot people inside a building while he was outside without his evil gun she said that the loophole should be closed to prevent something like this from ever happening again four or five other kids testified in favor of this bill one of spilling tears for the good legislators one of the students actually shot by wayne lo was also there many of them had t shirts on saying as long as one person can buy a gun in anger none of us are safe support gun control the committee was reluctant to grill or correct the kids except for caron who corrected one student who had claimed that anyone could apply for an fid only residents can get fid s he said how much do you want to bet that this kid had no idea he had been conned into testifying for a bill that would cut out of staters completely off yacino and mcnutt spoke again this time noting that the bill as written would affect both ammo and all guns possessed by out of staters karen also noted that hunters in ct nh and vt could be put away for a year if they wandered across the ma boundary somewhere in the woods and got challenged by game wardens yacino underscored the fact that lo could have gotten an fid as a resident student and hell even an ccw as he had no criminal or mental record one junior rep was upset that it would take ma residents longer to buy a gun than out of staters and thought it was elitist another caron said that we need the protection of preventing non residents from buying without an fid because only two other states in the union had fid type cards so complying with all the laws of one s home state was not enough one pro gun speaker replied that this resembled a mother watching her son in a marching band and exclaiming everyone s out of step but johnny all the bard college people were filing out as the pro gun testimony for this bill was made and thus only pro gunners were around when the other bills came under consideration the main bills remaining and goal s position were o h and four others notify police chiefs so they can pull licenses when a holder is convicted strongly supported o h require trigger locks on all handguns sold opposed o h require trigger locks on all loaded firearms strongly opposed o h allow every municipality to enact their own gun laws opposed o h fund bullet proof vests for municipal police supported o s state constitutional amendment for the rkba supported o several on police discretion in the issuance of fid cards opposed o several altering non resident license conditions supported o h ban damn near all guns everywhere in the state guess some of these took only seconds to consider as the remaining pro gunners raised hands in unison either for or against them mike yacino noted that besides the danger in screwing with a trigger lock on a loaded gun that bill would make it illegal for a licensee to carry his concealed handgun unless it were locked caron blew right through h when he saw that we opposed it again he brought up the state s archaic records capability and said this would create hundreds of different licensing systems the session ran late since it was the last scheduled hearing it could not be adjourned until everyone who wanted to had testified it ended at about

intended to prevent secret lawmaking by administrative bodies these practices amply documented in hearings before this sub committee leave little doubt that the bureau has disregarded rights guaranteed by the constitution and laws of the united states it has trampled upon the second amendment by chilling exercise of the right to keep and bear arms by law abiding citizens it has offended the fourth amendment by unreasonably search ing and seizing private property it has ignored the fifth amendment by taking private property without just compensation and by entrapping honest citizens with out regard for their right to due process of law the rebuttal presented to the subcommittee by the bureau was utterly unconvincing richard davis speaking on behalf of the treasury department asserted vaguely that the bureau s priorities were aimed at prosecuting willful violators particularly felons ille gally in possession and at confiscating only guns actually likely to be used in crime he also asserted that the bureau has recently made great strides toward achieving these priorities no documen tation was offered for either of these assertions in hearings before batf s appropriations subcommittee however expert evidence was submitted establishing that approximately percent of batf gun prosecutions were aimed at ordinary citizens who had neither criminal intent nor knowledge but were enticed by agents into unknowning technical violations exerpt from th congress d session committee print t h e r i g h t t o k e e p a n d b e a r a r m s report of the subcommittee on the

o washington letter to constituent april thank you for contacting me regarding the bureau of alcohol tobacco and firearms atf which is the federal law enforcement agency with jurisdiction over firearms violations and regulations it has been my experience as chairman of the appropriations subcommittee on treasury postal service and general government which funds atf that atf is one of the most competent and highly professional law enforcement agencies in the federal government the agents of atf have proven their value again and again in successful legal operations to curb the unlawful possession and use of firearms especially in the area of drug related crimes it enforces the armed career criminal act which calls for mandatory minimum sentences for repeat felons using firearms to carry out an illegal activity the bureau has made itself a key component in preventing gang related violence also both by educating at risk youth to the dangers of gang membership as well a s by depriving known gangs from access to weapons the waco texas case involved the execution of search warrants by atf on the branch davidians for illegal firearms and explosives possession automatics semi automatics and machine guns in addition to bombs and other explosives in virtually every gun case atf is asked to trace weapons through its national firearms tracing center where they keep all dealer and federal firearms license information atf is the federal governments firearms expert and routinely works with state and local police to execute warrants atf working with state and local law enforcement in texas and the u s attorneys office felt it was necessary to execute these warrants in order to legally establish that a crime had been committed and conclude a long and thorough investigation of illegal gun and explosives held by members of the branch davidians in addition atf carefully selected a sunday morning knowing from their source inside that the men would be separated from the women and children and not in the area where it was known that the illegal weapons were stored as you may be aware by now vernon howell a k a david koresh spiritual leader of the branch davidians was tipped of the impending execution of the search warrants unfortunately atf lost the element of surprise and the cult was able to arm themselves and prepare for atfs entry into the compound once a hostage situation presented itself the atf asked the fbi to become involved since the fbi is skilled in hostage negotiations in addition and military tanks were brought in due to the serious nature of the situation and firepower of the branch davidians based on what i have learned about atf s role in the branch davidian raid i believe the agency acted responsibly i am however deeply saddened by the loss of lives of the law enforcement agents who attempted to enter the compound and the civilian members of the cult i fully expect the department of treasury to conduct a thorough evaluation with representatives from law enforcement outside the department to be headed by the assistant secretary for enforcement in addition atf will conduct its own review of the waco operation i look forward to reviewing the findings of the evaluators and hope this situation in waco will be brought to a quick and peaceful conclusion sincerely dennis deconcini chairman subcommittee

caltech edu aaron ray clements writes the second amendment is a guarantee of the right to bear arms clearly and unequivocally without infringement unfortunately the second amendment is not as clear as you state if last part of it is taken along it follows what you have said the problem i have is with the first part of the single sentence which makes up the amendment the second amendment is a well regulated militia being necessary to the security militia of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear state arms shall not be infringed arms you didn t even get the capitalization correct try reading usca on the constitution or get any other correct version of the constitution this mention of a well regulated militia is what confuses me according to the federalist paper s a well regulated militia has a well defined structure and follows nationally uniform regulations perhaps you should actually read the federalist papers james madison federalist paper besides the advantage of being armed which the americans possess over the people of almost every other nation the existence of subordinate governments to which the people are attached and by which the militia officers are appointed forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of europe which are carried as far as the public resources will bear the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms james madison i annals of congress june the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed a well regulated militia composed of the body of the people trained to arms is the best and most natural defense of a free country alexander hamilton federalist paper on the organization of the militia little more can reasonably be aimed at with respect to the people at large than to have them properly armed and equipped and in order to see that this be not neglected it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year alexander hamilton federalist paper speaking of standing armies if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens little if at all inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow citizens but surely hamilton and madison didn t mean the people when they said people right that s why the amendment refers to the right of the militia your average year old male does not fall into the definition you re right the militia consists of all able bodied males and probably females under current interpretation therefore most members of the militia the one the every gun advocate refers to are not members of a well organized militia and therefore are not directly the amendment does nor refer to well organized it says well regulated i have some targets you may examine if you wish to check how well regulated i am mentioned in the amendment if this amendment wanted to allow every member of the militia to keep and bear arms why did it specificly mention a well organized militia in the same sentence as the right to keep and bear arms correct that s why the right is reserved to the people and that was to insure the people could form a well regulated militia not a well organized militia it could be argued that the first part of the sentence is separate from the last part if so why was it include in the same atomic unit of written what do atomic units have to do with this argument any moron can set h bar c instead of a separate sentence oh i see what your question is why don t you read the federalist papers james madison federalist paper regarding the general welfare clause nothing is more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars but what does madison know about the grammatical style of the nd he only wrote it the amendment also implies that the right to arms has to due with the security of a free state the federalist paper s mention of a well regulated militia gives many examples of how this militia protects the security of a free state all these examples are actions of a very organized force not some john q public with a gun that s obviously because you ve never actually read the federalist papers all that the second amendment clearly states to me is that the people s right to form well regulated militias shall not be infringed that is people have the right to join a well organized militia this well organized militia will of course provide training in how to use arms and in basic military tactics these training members of the militia can keep and bear the arms can t read huh show me where the document says well organized militia lastly reading through the federalist paper s on well organized militia it is very clear that many of the reasons for these militias one reason stated is the protection from a standing army these days the standing army could easily defeat a group consisting of every year old male and female not in the armied forces that is exactly why every person should be allowed to own any weapon currently in use in the armed forces another reason stated for well organized militias is to reduced the need for a standing army well the us armied forces have been a standing army for more than half the history of the us but the major reason is to protect against that very same army it seems to me the whole reason for the second amendment to give the people protection from the us government by guaranteeing that the people can over through the government if necessary is a little bit of an anachronism is this day and age maybe its time to re think how this should be done and amend the constitution appropriately abraham lincoln first inaugural address march this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it rep elbridge gerry of massachusetts spoken during floor debate over the second amendment i annals of congress at august what sir is the use of a militia it is to prevent the establishment of a standing army the bane of liberty whenever governments mean to invade the rights and liberties of the people they always

same tired old debates you lurkers can join in at any time you know ahhh talk politics guns the kindler gentler newsgroup who would have thought no not exactly the only reason for this sort of restriction is the possible endangerment of others a poorly maintained rifle is dangerous but only to the user since it doesn t endanger others there is no justification for such restrictions i remind you of shrapnel i consider a reasonable space limitation but make no mistake a gun blowing up is a hazard to those nearby say in the next lane at the range my point was at what distance or level of threat we draw the line is it the endangerment of others so we do a restriction or the possibility of being shot hence we draw a mile restriction or a nuke and draw a mile restriction to me they al suffer from the fundamental flaw that they restrict based upon the instrument rather than placing the responsibility for usage squarely upon the shoulders of the user perhaps sen metzenbaum declaring the barrett light fifty an assault rifle has made this more apparent to me since the barrett has only range and acurracy going for it they have determined that their lives are worth the effort to protect their homes and families using nuclear weapons close to home will not accomplish this i disagree on the grounds that a house can be rebuilt much more easily than my family once i have died i assume that word would get to the citizens that such an attack was planned if this is not the case the tactical and strategic implications change quite a bit personally my home is worth say twenty martians intent on taking over the world my family all of them the balancing act here is hard to judge sitting at my desk there is however another problem in any case of civil war the strength of the militias fighting on each side should reflect the popular will if the public is split versus then the minorities militias should be at a disadvantage such a need for popular support would hopefully prevent insurrections unless the people really were behind the rebels but heavy weapons owned by a small fraction of the militia could distort this what if the minority included all the tank and artillery owners that seems to be the case already given that heavy weapons aren t commonly owned by the citizenry with such low numbers obviously due to cost i don t think the superior weapons are going to be of great effect against a numerically superior foe furthermore it is even more doubtful their training includes proper tactical movements that best utilize tanks whereas the commonly rifleman is not so hampered in effectiveness i think it is vital to avoid such a situation where a small minority would have a reasonable chance of gaining political power through violence to prevent this it may be necessary to give control of heavy weapons e g those which only a small number of individuals would own and whose firepower would grossly distort the relation between popular support and military strength to someone other that individual militiamen this is certainly not a good thing but i think it is the lesser of two evils whoever controls these weapons must be a democratic body responsive to the will of the people i had envisioned that the armorer perhaps the officers of a select group and the like would exercise control over the heavier more complex weapons but if joe bob owns an old sherman tank i certainly wouldn t ask him to give it up follow orders from the officers yes since the expense of a tank is so large though chances are it would be jointly purchased and should therefore be jointly maintained and operated here i think we have to be carefull about which state we are talking about certainly one role of the militia is to overthrow a repressive government and it would be completely destructive to that end for that same government to control the militia s arms but the united states have several levels of government each able to act independently but not all likely targets of rebelion as such rebelions against state and local governments are very unlikely i think therefore that the state or possibly local governments could safely be allowed to keep the select militia s heavy weapons the risk of abuse while still something to consider is far less than the similar risk were the federal government in control this i ll agree with to a point the state having control over the heavy weapons should not be justification for the state to have them centrally located keep them spread out such that the ability of the state to lock them up isn t so easy otherwise i would have to assume that state control would rest on the authority of the governor and militia officers that is eaxctly why i think they should be removed the select militia should privide the militia s heavy weapons and highly trained specialists for the reasons i have outlines above i think these heavy weapons tanks artillery aircraft etc are better off being kept by local governments than by a small number of individuals however local governments shouldn t be able to use the select militia without the support to the people ideally the general militia under the direct control of the people and the select militia under the direction of democratic local governments would opperate together but even in the worst case the general militia should be able to functional without the select militia similarly the select militia should be incapable of action without the aid of the general militia i m having a hard time seeing how these heavy weapons fairly few in numbers could not be easily wielded by a few people with government support just as you argued above that the weapons should be divvied up and under democratic control so one side doesn t have all of them i can t see where this situation is alleviated in having the select militia holding all the weapons and the unorganized militia being the infantry i think a better mix is called for but i would argue that the federal army should rely upon the select militia and the unorganized militia for the bulk of its infantry units consider then the effect of removing the national guard s infantry and placing the guard under the control of local governments the government controled select militia could not fight effectively without infantry support provided by the general militia an inherently infantry organization on the other hand the general militia could function although at a disadvantage without the backing of local governments and the select militia we have to assume that there would be those who would side with the government controlled forces and if they ve all the equipment an infantry force x the size would be in trouble i d like to see that heavy stuff say tanks offset by the local troups having a few s and anti tank weapons in their armory these would be much more useful to infantry than the tank would be when cost and training requirements are figured in i suppose i m quibbling over what constitutes heavy equipment but a mechanized infantry unit is what builds dikes in times of flood sets up disaster relief cities and the like i would much rather see these things handled by the local general militias so would i but the resources often aren t available to outfit local units well enough thus we will certainly have to call in others and a mechanized unit carries more stuff faster than anything else perhaps the national guard isn t as close to my conception of the select militia as i thought i was considering them to be the heavy weapons armor arm of the militia not the infantry arm of the regular army perhaps our ideas of heavy weapons are different i think main battle tanks self propelled artillery and mm and up field pieces are heavy stuff m troop carriers ton trucks humvee s old m tanks howitzers are more the stuff of a mechanized infantry actually this is what the guard units in iowa are currently fielding in some units perhaps it is just my innate fear of having the real heavy equipment under state control with little but numbers and light stuff to act as a deterrent allowing main battle tanks to the states should be balanced with anti tank capability in the local ranks similarly local units would need to band together quickly hence small and fast response means mechanized infantry finally the militia is more than just fighting equipment is needed for other responses the federal army i m convinced should have a very minumum of infantry relying on the state and local militias for these functions dan sorenson dod z dan exnet

4566###talk.politics.guns###re batf fbi revenge does anyone have any idea about the size of waco i m just curious because if it were a small town that may have something to do with it possibly not it sure didn t take it very long to burn down though i was watching abc and it only took like a little over minutes to burn down waco is a city of about people the population temporarily raised to about people when all the feds and state police officers arrived i tell you what i stayed in a hotel room about miles from the bd compound around weeks ago i have never felt more paranoid in my whole life there were at least state police in the hotel the claim we had the water turned off so the fire engines had to bring their own doesn t hold up if they had cut off the water they surely could have turned it back on just as quickly they just didn t want to there were some scores to settle message to anybody else is very clear don t fuck with us we will do you in not that i am one to believe that everything that the government tells us is true but if that was the message they wanted to send why did they wait days i think the message would be better sent by charging in there right away not waiting for days and pounding them with sound etc a bunch of dead bd members are not going to be so able to tell their side of the story so now all we have is the story according to the batf and fbi also mr care about the rights of people clinton or his administration approved this action fbi said washington had approved it they fbi said the gas masks used by the bds have a finite life and were close to running out why couldn t they have just waited well there are people supposedly alive they can tell their story as far as bill clinton is concerned don t you think he has more pressing matters to attend to besides some small group of people in texas how about bosnia now there s a problem why couldn t they have waited they waited too long as it is something should have been done earlier they gov is trying to say it was a mass suicide in the past they had expressed this was a real possibility but now they decided it wasn t a possibility so they could go on with the raid apparantly what they feel korash was or was not capable of or going to do was driven by what was most convenient at the time now this means that the public and media will forget about all this having become weary of it this has already happened for many people there will be no investigation independent or otherwise or a whitewash very much a possibility there will be no unsealing of the warrant and related documents what anybody will know about this incident will be the batf version with the way our government is i wouldn t doubt it the batf has just been given carte blanche for further abuses with the effective support and approval of the administration clinton said on the news that he knew about what was happening but that it was all in the hands of the fbi that is if you choose to believe the media there will be more abuses with no concern of administration censure the precident has been established that the feds can kill in quantity to achieve their aims especially if the target is excercising their rights under the second amendment and the rest of the bill of rights and is a government declared un nice fellow if they had rocket launchers and such as the press and gov claims why shouldn t they have done something what possible use would a religious cult have for a rocket launcher also is child abuse covered by the bill of rights lls and clams will be pleased dung tsow ping sp will be pleased saddam hussein sp will be pleased idi amin would be pleased stalin would be pleased even hitler would be pleased any self respecting despot would nod and say well done bill clinton well then there are probably a lot of self respecting despots in the us cause i m sure they feel the same way god bless america land of the free past tense well maybe i am overreacting but i see on the tv as i am typing where maybe maybe not there are a lot of questions that should be raised about this incident the problem is who will do it and be heard govt spoksewoman the new attorney general known to be almost rabid about private ownership of guns wants to ban assault guns and just about everything else is saying the fbi had amazing restraint then falls back into the official goverenment line about how the bd were guity of child abuse and were into it in an on going basis and so on note that according to the liberal elite giving a child a spanking is regarded as child abuse seriously if it gets known the state can take your child away from you if you spank your kid she also is saying which state is that the federal government or an individual state government clinton personally approved this operation she told him it was appropriate and so on and he said ok do it somehow i am not surprised the people must know who is boss who is in charge and it is obviouly no longer the people it seems to me that the people haven t been in charge for a long time if they really were i don t think the government would be doing as many things as it has in the past and i maintain the appropriate response as far as this raid by batf is concerned regarding child abuse is so what batf are not our child protective services police yet after all the bd had been tried on that charge before and found not guilty the gov t people have pretty much gone silent on the terrible illegal guns bd supposedly has and stress the continued child abuse apparantly to make it a seem as sort of a rescue operation figuring everyone hates child abusers and anything is ok to use against them occasional references to ammunition possesed by the bds and so on is irrelevant it is not illegal to have ammunition yet true but is it illegal to have a rocket launcher am i having a vain hope that an honest investigation will occur on this thing or will it simply be whitewashed under the rug and business as usual will continue to be the order of the day in the new order who will be given the official title of thought police i wonder and if clinton and friends have their way highly likely at this point the new order government will also have all the guns so what if is going to be ten years late i think we are going to discover that we will be paying dearly for putting this fellow in office for decades to come even some die hard supporters are having serious doubts about their savior shit if people dont get what they want right away there is an instant problem clinton has only been in office for a few months give him a chance to get something done the guy had a lot of shit thrown in his lap in the beginning give him a chance to work on things a little as they say rome wasn t built in a day yes i am upset i see no good as far as civil individual rights to come of any of his proposals decisions for the last month or so we have really been had or bill of rights is now nothing but a quaint curiosity i highly doubt that it is that bad yet how about the rodney king trial the two people who were most responsible got the axe how bad the axe falls tho is yet to be

4590###talk.politics.guns###weird science by l neil smith posted by cathy smith for l neil smith weird science everyone knows how to tell when a politician is lying his lips move what may not be equally obvious is that there are politicians and then there are politicians and that the phrase political science is subject to more than one interpretation years ago we heard how scientists were worried that a new ice age might be coming and later on that nuclear winter smoke and dust thrown into the atmosphere by full scale international unpleasantness was a possibility something like that may even have killed the dinosaurs what we didn t hear was that no actual data supported any of this that real world events the burning of kuwaiti oil fields tended to discredit it that mostly it was propaganda meant to weaken values that made america the most successful culture in history and that the dinosaurs probably died of something like the plague when continents drifted together exposing them to new germs we miss a lot like this unless we listen closely prince william sound site of the famous oil spill and mount st helen s weren t supposed to recover from their respective disasters for at least years that turned out not to be true although you d never know it from watching network nightly news or cnn it doesn t fit their agenda to inform us that the earth is vast and resilient and that nature is rougher on herself than we could ever be but for once the media aren t entirely to blame as ignorant of science as they are of everything they trust scientists to unscrew the inscrutable the trouble is that today s scientists have agendas of their own nobody in government that wellspring of scientific wherewithal is going to offer grants to an investigator who states truthfully that there is no respectable evidence for global warming the money and power for bureaucrats and politicians lie in mass transit and they hate the automobile blamed as a major cause of the mythical crisis as a source of privacy and freedom they find intolerable the same appears true of acid rain a deliberate hoax cooked up by the environmental protection agency which hates private industrial capitalism almost as much as it does your car and foisted on real scientists through trickery which has depended on specialists in different fields not talking to each other much the list goes on always with a common disreputable thread ozone depletion for which evidence is even more suspect and contradictory than for acid rain or global warming is no more than a last desperate attempt to indict private capitalism in an era when state central planning and the command economy have failed and can only find this final withered leg to teeter on decades of anti nuclear alarmism resting on foundations of myth and panic mongering have failed to erase the fact that nuclear power is the safest cleanest most efficient source of energy known to mankind and more to the point that the greater amount of energy there is available to any individual in society the freer that individual and his society become honest studies on the effects of individual gun ownership and self defense on crime conducted by investigators who began as ideological opponents to those concepts but which show massive reductions in the latter to be the result of the former have been suppressed most recently by the california state government and what the media didn t say about recent epa discoveries on the effect of secondhand smoking is that although some harm to non smokers may have been detected it was less by an order or two of magnitude than that associated with frying bacon a couple times a week or keeping a pet bird it s enough to make you wonder whether there was ever anything to the claim that smoking causes cancer that of course is the real threat represented by politically correct science the world is a dangerous place it would be nice to know the hazards i ve never believed smoking to be a healthy practice but given a lack of credibility on the part of today s science how am i to decide what to do about it nicotine is highly addictive to that much i can attest from experience yet the stress of quitting may be riskier than to continue there isn t any way to tell thanks to the corrupting influence of government money on the scientific establishment two centuries ago the founding fathers spared us certain agonies to which every other nation in the world has been subject at one time or another by creating a legal barrier between politics and religion each time some short sighted individual or group has tried to lower the barrier most recently over the issue of abortion blood real human blood hot and smoking in the street has wound up being shed real human blood is being shed over scientific issues as people s lives are ruined through the loss to agencies like the epa of livelihood or property it may have taken a lifetime to accumulate to diseases caused by toxins associated with burning fossil fuels for electrical power or thanks to bans on things like cyclamates when they die from the effects of obesity what we need now if we hope to survive as a civilization for two more centuries is another barrier a constitutional separation of state and science including medicine knowledge is valuable real science won t languish for lack of funding the

organization netcom online communication services guest references swood vela lines along the lines of the armed citizen here s a story that some of you may find amusing it s a story about arizona house hunting from leslie fish musician and author one of the reasons i m planning to move to arizona is that despite its lousy economy way race problems simmering religious problems and hopelessly bad government arizona has one of the lowest violent crime rates in the country is it just coincidence that arizona is also one of the few remaining no gun control states in the country well consider this funny story last time i was in phoenix staying with liz burnham i did some checking on the local real estate market that s when i discovered that with my income as provable by my tax returns i can qualify for every low income housing loan in the book with the exception of va and i came across an astonishing ad in the local market paper it offered a three bedroom house in the phoenix area for are you ready for this all of no money down per month total payments christ on a harley davidson i called up the real estate office making this offer made it clear that i was only checking the local market and asked about that house were the walls roof and foundation structurally sound yes were the plumbing and electrical systems functional and up to code yes did the air conditioning system an absolute necessity in phoenix work yes again okay so what was wrong with the house well it needed lots of plastering painting yard work and some patching of the roof and yes low interest repair loans were available okay sez i if that s all that s wrong with it just why are you selling a bedroom house for all of well squirms the agent it s in kind of a bad neighborhood how bad sez i remembering some of the neighborhoods i ve seen in chicago and oakland worst in the city the agent sighs and then he told me this amazing story every few years it seems the big vice gangs in los angeles notice that there s no gang presence in phoenix which is just a quick hour drive from la and get the idea of setting up a subsidiary there well a couple years ago the colonizing force came to this neighborhood it being poor and spanish they figured they could move right in and take over bought this house and started operations unfortunately for them the neighbors not only didn t like this they didn t care for whores trotting up and down their streets all night pimps soliciting their kids dope deals on the corners in broad daylight and so on they weren t afraid to do something about it the neighbors called the cops for some reason the phoenix police are remarkably honest capable polite and prompt and the cops promptly came and swept up all the whores pimps and pushers off the street and away to jail the remaining gang members decided to retaliate in the fashion they usually use in la they got the complainant s name and address off the court records and did a drive by shooting at his house well this wasn t los angeles the moment the neighbors heard the first gunshots fired they all ran out their front doors with their own guns rifles shotguns pistols everything and shot back the car didn t make it to the end of the block it coasted to a stop riddled with more holes than the famous bonnie and clyde getaway car which i ve seen it s on display in a casino in a casino in las vegas the gas tank and fuel lines had been ruptured so the car caught fire the neighbors waited a good minutes making sure nobody got out of that car before they called the fire department to come put out the fire and tow the wreck away by that time the asphalt under the car had melted and caught fire too which subsequently left a large and nasty pot hole in the street the city is slow about repairing small streets so the hole stayed there providing a traffic hazard for several months all this was two years ago the agent concluded and there s been no trouble since but the house and the neighborhood still have a bad reputation and that s why the house was so cheap hearing this story i nearly laughed my ass off i told the agent that if i had the money at the moment i d by god buy the house this was nothing compared to bad neighborhoods i d seen here in california where drive by shootings go unchecked by the well armed cops let alone by the unarmed neighbors if that s the absolute worst you ll find in phoenix then that s the city for me that s the difference that an armed civilian population makes think about it mike van pelt when guns are outlawed mvp netcom com only carl

4670###talk.politics.guns###re some more about gun control in article apr mtu edu cescript mtu edu charles scripter writes this mention of a well regulated militia is what confuses me according to the federalist paper s a well regulated militia has a well defined structure and follows nationally uniform regulations perhaps you should actually read the federalist papers perhaps you should reread federal which deals exclusively with the well regulated malitia here is what is says about its character to oblige the great body of the yeomanry and of the other classes of the citizens to be under arms for the purpose of going through military exercises and evolutions as often as might be necessary to acquire the degree of perfection which would entitle them to the character of a well regulated militia it also talks about the well regulated militia having a nationally uniform in structure and disipline i will note you did quote the end of this particular paragraph which states little more can reasonably be aimed at with respect to the people at large than to have them properly armed and equipped and in order to see that this be not neglected it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year but do you knew how much organization is required to training a large group of poeple twice a year just to try to get the same people every year provide a basic training to new people so they can be integrated into the force and find a suitable location it requires a continually standing committee of organizers since a well regulate militia is nationally uniform in structure and disipline and meet once or twice a year to train how can you claim a well regulated militia is not well organized but i will concide a well organized militia is not necessarily a well regulated militia several people have stated that the well organized militia is what is defined under usc which states the militia of the united states consists of all able bodied males at least years of age and except as provided in section of title under years of age who are or who have made a declaration of intention to become citizens of the united states and of female citizents of the united states who are commissioned officers of the national guard this deos define the militia but were is the adjective well regulated usc does not define a well regualed militia in any way shape or form it only defines who can become part of a well regulated militia the federalist papers clearly define the well regualed militia as a proper subset of the militia in the same paragraph quoted above it talk above disciplining all the militia of the united states so they fit the character of a well regulated militia this is what the paragraph states about the associated costs it would form an annual deduction from the productive labor of the country to an amount which calculating upon the present numbers of the people would not fall far short of the whole expense of the civil establishments of all the states to attempt a thing which would abridge the mass of labor and industry to so considerable an extent would be unwise and the experiment if made could not succeed because it would not long be endured another quote provide by charles scripter is james madison federalist paper regarding the general welfare clause nothing is more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars so the phrase the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed must either qualify or explain the phrase a well regulated militia being necessary to the security of a free state the definition of explain as stated in the american hertitage dictionary of the enlish language the new college edition is to make plain or comprehensible remove obscruity from elucidate it was the economists who undertook to explain this puzzle to define explicate expound he explained his plan to offer reasons for or a cause of an answer for justify explain an error the second phrase clearly does not explain the first therefore the second phrase must qualify the first the definition given for qualify is to describe by enumerating the characteristics or qualities of characterize to make competent or suitable for office position or task to give legal power to make legally capable to modify limit or restrict as giving exceptions to make less harsh or severe moderate grammar to modify the meaning of a word or phrase since the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed does not describe modify or make less harsh anything and it has nothing to do with grammar or some sort of position or task by process of elimination it must fall into definition and since deals with legal power the same thing the constitution does it must be the correct definition in this case therefore the right of the people to keep and bear arms gives legal power to the well regualated militia and this legal power shall not be infringed i thank you very much mr scripter you have provided me with more evidence that the second amendment only concerns itseft with the people s right to form well regulate militia and says very little about the right of an untrained person to keep and bear a caliber machine gun and since i totally untrained in the use of any firearm something i personly have meant to correct by going to a nra gun safety course and joining a gun club cannot legally buy such a machine gun i conclude the courts and democraticly elected congress agree with me so now we know which category mr rutledge is in he means to destroy our liberties and rights i mean to destory our liberties and rights is that why a participate in the discussion of exactly what our libertues and rights are i force my version of our liberties and rights by begining statements of what our liberties and rights with all that the second amendment clearly states to me using expressions such as states to me clearly mean i intend to force my views on others i don t think so so in effort not to force my views and not to destory our liberties and rights i state that nothing i have written or will write in the matter of liberties and rights is the final word for i am only one person among many and the final word on liberties and rights cleary and irrevocably

4697###talk.politics.guns###re some more about gun control first i would like to say how much i appreciate having so literate and erudite an individual as mr rutledge with whom to discuss this topic frankly most anti rkba posters refuse even to approach the topic of the original understanding of the bill of rights as detailed in the writings of the era this is most refreshing second i must apologize for leaving the discussion for several days my brigade s quarterly drill was this weekend and i needed to attend to several matters pertaining to the state militia some people seem to feel that the concept of the militia is an anachro nism that is out of place in the th century i m not sure the swiss would agree and i think perhaps a discussion of how the militia both organized and unorganized fits into the defense plans of my state mississippi please do not assume that this describes something peculiar to one southern state for instance the commonwealth of massachusetts has a well organized militia which members report maintains stocks of both riot guns and machine guns the laws of other states will vary but are probably similar title of mississippi code defines our militia as all able bodied citizens of the state between the ages of seventeen and sixty two years the militia is divided into classes the national guard the mississippi state guard and the unorganized militia the national guard is a strange sort of fish from a constitutional perspective it tries to be both state militia and federal reserve the discussion of this para constitutional arrangement is quite interesting in itself but somewhat beyond the scope of this discussion suffice it that at this date the national guard has ceased to have any constitutional standing as anything but a federal reserve force mississippi and most other states maintains a purely state organized militia in mississippi this is called the state guard in other states it may be called something else the state guard exists as a cadre or training corps made up of mostly experienced officers and senior ncos who serve as volunteers without compensation we drill on a monthly basis at the company and battalion level brigade once a quarter and have an annual drill of the whole organization our state authorized cadre strength is this is a skeleton of an organization without any flesh the muscle and sinew when needed will come from the unorganized militia in time of invasion insurrection or calamity the governor can order the activation of the state guard when this takes place a call will first be made for volunteers to fill the organization out to either its contingency strength of or full strength of in the event that a sufficient number of people fail to volunteer the law provides detailed instructions for the conducting of a draft of the unorganized militia the size of the state guard is not specified by law but rather by executive order at one time the organized militia of mississippi consisted of regiments needless to say the state does not have armories brimming with weapons with which to equip such a force the historical precedent for arming such a force is by use of mostly the private arms of the militiamen it is my hope that demonstrates that state militias are far from being the long dead anachronisms that some may wish to claim no i simple stated that the people have a right to join a well organized militia and i have also stated that a militia that meets once or twice a year is clearly well organized and this state of readiness that i have claimed the people have a right to is the same state of readiness expected of the militia as stated by hamilton regarding hamilton if you take hamilton s opinion as being the sole representative of the opinions of the founding fathers you will have chosen a highly skewed sample set hamilton was on the extreme federalist end of the political spectrum others such as coxe and henry can be chosen to represent the other end many contemporaries felt that the idea of having a standing army of any sort or even a select militia or train bands were contrary to the egalitarian nature of the govern ment they were striving to perfect the compromise reached was to provide for a small army which had to be refinanced every two years and iron clad protection for the militia which was to remain ever terrible and irresistible these protections included state control not federal limitation of federal utilization of the militia i e execute laws suppress insurrections and repel invasions and the right to keep and bear arms to prevent what the british had tried to do at lexington these limitations eventually proved so onerous to the federal govern ment that they were skirted by the creation of the national guard the national guard was created for one very simple reason the constitutional militia was had proved too unreliable for fighting wars of imperial expansion e g spanish american war the constitution provided that the militia could only be employed by the federal government in very limited purposes as far back as the war of militia units had refused to leave united states territory to attack the enemy further there was no constitutional authorization for any conscription of anyone into the federal military and militiamen were particularly protected in all wars until ww i every american who left the country under arms was a volunteer when the national guard acts of required that each new member also enlist as a reservest in the army existing soldiers were grandfathered at least one of these grandfathered individuals refused to go to france in and his refusal was upheld by the federal courts mr rutledge has stated that the second amendment applies only to members of a well organized militia however the pre constitutional history of the american militia shows relatively few periods when the militia came close to meeting either messrs rutledge or hamilton s definition of well organized in the period of peace between the french indian war and the revolution many companies simply stopped drilling and had to be reconstituted just prior to the revolution perhaps mr rutledge would care to argue that those of my ancestors who answered the lexington alarm had forfeited their rights because their units didn t drill for a few years in the s i would not be so bold again i wish to repeat the national guard for all its merits is not the militia described by the constitution nor by mr hamilton nor by mr henry nor by mr coxe the fact that the federal government and many states are delinquent in their attentions to and organizing of their constitutional militias diminishes neither their responsibilities nor the rights of the militia as detailed in the constitution misunderstanding of the nature and purpose of the militia is but one error that has crept into modern readings of the constitution the constitution prohibits states from keeping troops or ships of war in time of peace i have heard some insist this prevents states from maintaining a militia but this comes about because people today do not understand the meanings of the words in their th century usage today we call any large vessel a ship but in the th century the word described a particular kind of vessel a ship is a large vessel with three or more masts each carrying square rigged sails a brig has two masts in the contemporary usage the states were prohibited only from keeping the largest warships of the day those capable of global operations today s equivalent might be a prohibition on the states keeping nuclear missiles troops at this time meant a full time professional military organization any study of contemporaneous writings will bear this out in at least one respect i am in agreement with mr rutledge being personally involved in the maintenance and advancement of the militia as a viable means of defense for a modern society i am frequently both bemused and saddened when friends and associates wax poetic on their place in the unorganized militia and become strangely silent or scarce when invited to attend a drill of their state s militia

4713###talk.politics.guns###waco clinton press conference part here is a press release from the white house president clinton s remarks on waco with q a to national desk contact white house office of the press secretary washington april following are remarks by president clinton in a question and answer session with the press p m edt the president on february the th four federal agents were killed in the line of duty trying to enforce the law against the branch davidian compound which had illegally stockpiled weaponry and ammunition and placed innocent children at risk because the batf operation had failed to meet its objective a day standoff ensued the federal bureau of investigation then made every reasonable effort to bring this perilous situation to an end without bloodshed and further loss of life the bureau s efforts were ultimately unavailing because the individual with whom they were dealing david koresh was dangerous irrational and probably insane he engaged in numerous activities which violated both federal law and common standards of decency he was moreover responsible for the deaths and injuries which occurred during the action against the compound in february given his inclination towards violence and in an effort to protect his young hostages no provocative actions were taken for more than seven weeks by federal agents against the compound this weekend i was briefed by attorney general reno on an operation prepared by the fbi designed to increase pressure on koresh and persuade those in the compound to surrender peacefully the plan included a decision to withhold the use of ammunition even in the face of fire and instead to use tear gas that would not cause permanent harm to health but would it was hoped force the people in the compound to come outside and to surrender i was informed of the plan to end the siege i discussed it with attorney general reno i asked the questions i thought it was appropriate for me to ask i then told her to do what she thought was right and i take full responsibility for the implementation of the decision yesterday s action ended in a horrible human tragedy mr koresh s response to the demands for his surrender by federal agents was to destroy himself and murder the children who were his captives as well as all the other people who were there who did not survive he killed those he controlled and he bears ultimate responsibility for the carnage that ensued now we must review the past with an eye towards the future i have directed the united stated departments of justice and treasury to undertake a vigorous and thorough investigation to uncover what happened and why and whether anything could have been dne differently i have told the departments to involve independent professional law enforcement officials in the investigation i expect to receive analysis and answers in whatever time is required to complete the review finally i have directed the departments to cooperate fully with all congressional inquiries so that we can continue to be fully accountable to the american people i want to express my appreciation to the attorney general to the justice department and to the federal agents on the front lines who did the best job they could under deeply difficult circumstances again i want to say as i did yesterday i am very sorry for the loss of life which occurred at the beginning and at the end of this tragedy in waco i hope very much that others who will be tempted to join cults and to become involved with people like david koresh will be deterred by the horrible scenes they have seen over the last seven weeks and i hope very much that the difficult situations which federal agents confronted there and which they will be doubtless required to confront in other contexts in the future will be somewhat better handled and better understood because of what has been learned now q mr president can you first of all tell us why after days you decided q mr president can you describe for us what it is that janet reno outlined to you in your minute phone conversation with the president i can t hear you both if one will go first and then the other q sorry can you describe what janet reno q mr president the president i ll answer both your questions but i can t do it at once q can you describe what she told you on sunday about the nature of the operation and how much detail you knew about it the president yes i was told by the attorney general that the fbi strongly felt that the time had come to take another step in trying to dislodge the people in the compound and she described generally what the operation would be that they wanted to go in and use tear gas which had been tested not to cause permanent damage to adults or to children but which would make it very difficult for people to stay inside the building and it was hoped that the tear gas would permit them to come outside i was further told that under no circumstances would our people fire any shots at them even if fired upon they were going to shoot the tear gas from armored vehicles which would protect them and there would be no exchange of fire in fact as you know an awful lot of shots were fired by the cult members at the federal officials there were no shots coming back from the government side i asked a number of questions the first question i asked is why now we have waited seven weeks why now the reasons i was given were the following number one that there was a limit to how long the federal authorities could maintain with their limited resources the quality and intensity of coverage by experts there they might be needed in other parts of the country number two that the people who had reviewed this had never seen a case quite like this one before and they were convinced that no progress had been made recently and no progress was going to be made through the normal means of getting koresh and the other cult members to come out number three that the danger of their doing something to themselves or to others was likely to increase not decrease with the passage of time and number four that they had reason to believe that the children who were still inside the compound were being abused significantly as well as being forced to live in unsanitary and unsafe conditions so for those reasons they wanted to move at that time the second question i asked the attorney general is whether they had given consideration to all of the things that could go wrong and evaluated them against what might happen that was good she said that the fbi personnel on the scene and those working with them were convinced that the chances of bad things happening would only increase with the passage of time the third question i asked was has the military been consulted as soon as the initial tragedy came to light in waco that s the first thing i asked to be done because it was obvious that this was not a typical law enforcement situation military people were then brought in helped to analyze the situation and some of the problems that were presented by it and so i asked if the military had been consulted the attorney general said that they had and that they were in basic agreement that there was only one minor tactical difference of opinion between the fbi and the military something that both sides thought was not of overwhelming significance having asked those questions and gotten those answers i said that if she thought it was the right thing to do that she should proceed and that i would support it and i stand by that today q mr president the president wait go ahead q can you address the widespread perception reported widely television radio and newspapers that you were trying somehow to distance yourself from this disaster the president no i m bewildered by it the only reason i made no public statement yesterday let me say the only reason i made no public statement yesterday is that i had nothing to add to what was being said and i literally did not know until rather late in the day whether anybody was still alive other than those who had been actually seen and taken to the hospital or taken into custody it was purely and simply a question of waiting for events to unfold there was i have i can t account for why people speculated one way or the other but i talked to the attorney general on the day before the action took place i talked to her yesterday i called her again late last night after she appeared on the larry king show and i talked to her again this morning a president it is not possible for a president to distance himself from things that happen when the federal government is in control i will say this however i was frankly surprised would be a mild word to say that anyone that would suggest that the attorney general should resign because some religious fanatics murdered themselves applause i regret what happened but it is not possible in this life to control the behavior of others in every circumstance these people killed four federal officials in the line of duty they were heavily armed they fired on federal officials yesterday repeatedly and they were never fired back on we did everything we could to avoid the loss of life they made the decision to immolate themselves and i regret it terribly and i feel awful about the children but in the end the last comment i had from janet reno is when and i talked to her on sunday i said now i want you to tell me once more why you believe not why they believe why you believe we should move now rather than wait some more and she said it s because of the children they have evidence that those children are still being abused and that they re in increasingly unsafe conditions and that they don t think it will get any easier with time with the passage of time i have to take their word for that so that is where i think things stand q can we assume then that you don t think this was mishandled in view of the outcome that you didn t run out of patience and if you had it to do over again would you really decide that way the president no well i think what you can assume is just exactly what i announced today this is a the fbi has done a lot of things right for this country over a long period of time this is the same fbi that found the people that bombed the world trade center in lickety split record time we want an inquiry to analyze the steps along the way is there something else we should have known is there some other question they should have asked is there some other question i should have asked can i say for sure that no one that we could have done nothing else to make the outcome come different i don t know that that s why i want the inquiry and that s why i would like to make sure that we have some independent law enforcement people not political people but totally non political outside experts who can bring to bear the best evidence we have there is unfortunately a rise in this sort of fanaticism all across the world and we may have to confront it again and i want to know whether there is anything we can do particularly when there are children involved but i do think it is important to recognize that the wrong doers in this case were the people who killed others and then killed themselves q mr president were there any other options presented to you for resolving this situation at any point from february th until yesterday the president well yes i got regular reports all along the way there were lots of other options pursued if you go back you all covered it very well the fbi you did a very good job of it i mean the fbi and the other authorities there pursued any number of other options all along the way and a lot of them early on seemed to be working some of the children got out some of the other people left there was a at one point there seemed to be some lines of communication opening up between koresh and the authorities and then he would say things and not do them and things just began to spin downward whether there were other in terms of what happened yesterday the conversation i had with the attorney general did not involve other options except whether we should take more time with the present strategy we were pursuing because they said they wanted to do this because they thought this was the best way to get people out of the compound quickly before they could kill themselves that s what they thought q did the government know that the children did not have gas masks q congressional hearings once the situation are you in agreement with that the president that s up to the congress they can do whatever they want but i think it s very important that the treasury and justice departments launch this investigation and bring in some outside experts and as i said in my statement if any congressional committees want to look into it we will fully cooperate there is nothing to hide here this was probably the most well covered operation of its kind in the history of the country more more

rutledge wrote in article q tpinnpcn gap caltech edu arc cco caltech edu aaron ray clements writes the second amendment is a guarantee of the right to bear arms clearly and unequivocally without infringement unfortunately the second amendment is not as clear as you state if last part of it is taken along it follows what you have said the problem i have is with the first part of the single sentence which makes up the amendment the second amendment is a well regulated militia being necessary to the security militia of a free state the right of the people to keep and bear state arms shall not be infringed arms you didn t even get the capitalization correct try reading usca on the constitution or get any other correct version of the constitution this mention of a well regulated militia is what confuses me according to the federalist paper s a well regulated militia has a well defined structure and follows nationally uniform regulations perhaps you should actually read the federalist papers james madison federalist paper besides the advantage of being armed which the americans possess over the people of almost every other nation the existence of subordinate governments to which the people are attached and by which the militia officers are appointed forms a barrier against the enterprises of ambition more insurmountable than any which a simple government of any form can admit of notwithstanding the military establishments in the several kingdoms of europe which are carried as far as the public resources will bear the governments are afraid to trust the people with arms james madison i annals of congress june the right of the people to keep and bear arms shall not be infringed a well regulated militia composed of the body of the people trained to arms is the best and most natural defense of a free country alexander hamilton federalist paper on the organization of the militia little more can reasonably be aimed at with respect to the people at large than to have them properly armed and equipped and in order to see that this be not neglected it will be necessary to assemble them once or twice in the course of a year alexander hamilton federalist paper speaking of standing armies if circumstances should at any time oblige the government to form an army of any magnitude that army can never be formidable to the liberties of the people while there is a large body of citizens little if at all inferior to them in discipline and the use of arms who stand ready to defend their own rights and those of their fellow citizens but surely hamilton and madison didn t mean the people when they said people right that s why the amendment refers to the right of the militia your average year old male does not fall into the definition you re right the militia consists of all able bodied males and probably females under current interpretation therefore most members of the militia the one the every gun advocate refers to are not members of a well organized militia and therefore are not directly the amendment does nor refer to well organized it says well regulated i have some targets you may examine if you wish to check how well regulated i am mentioned in the amendment if this amendment wanted to allow every member of the militia to keep and bear arms why did it specificly mention a well organized militia in the same sentence as the right to keep and bear arms correct that s why the right is reserved to the people and that was to insure the people could form a well regulated militia not a well organized militia it could be argued that the first part of the sentence is separate from the last part if so why was it include in the same atomic unit of written what do atomic units have to do with this argument any moron can set h bar c instead of a separate sentence oh i see what your question is why don t you read the federalist papers james madison federalist paper regarding the general welfare clause nothing is more natural nor common than first to use a general phrase and then to explain and qualify it by a recital of particulars but what does madison know about the grammatical style of the nd he only wrote it the amendment also implies that the right to arms has to due with the security of a free state the federalist paper s mention of a well regulated militia gives many examples of how this militia protects the security of a free state all these examples are actions of a very organized force not some john q public with a gun that s obviously because you ve never actually read the federalist papers all that the second amendment clearly states to me is that the people s right to form well regulated militias shall not be infringed that is people have the right to join a well organized militia this well organized militia will of course provide training in how to use arms and in basic military tactics these training members of the militia can keep and bear the arms can t read huh show me where the document says well organized militia lastly reading through the federalist paper s on well organized militia it is very clear that many of the reasons for these militias one reason stated is the protection from a standing army these days the standing army could easily defeat a group consisting of every year old male and female not in the armied forces that is exactly why every person should be allowed to own any weapon currently in use in the armed forces another reason stated for well organized militias is to reduced the need for a standing army well the us armied forces have been a standing army for more than half the history of the us but the major reason is to protect against that very same army it seems to me the whole reason for the second amendment to give the people protection from the us government by guaranteeing that the people can over through the government if necessary is a little bit of an anachronism is this day and age maybe its time to re think how this should be done and amend the constitution appropriately abraham lincoln first inaugural address march this country with its institutions belongs to the people who inhabit it whenever they shall grow weary of the existing government they can exercise their constitutional right of amending it or their revolutionary right to dismember it or overthrow it rep elbridge gerry of massachusetts spoken during floor

mortal risks date mon feb est folks hail from the nether world on february th the wall street journal carried a front page article by erik larson entitled armed force i felt a reply was in order to his citation of the notorious scare stat that a gun is times more likely to kill than to protect i sent the following to the wsj gun stats mortal risks preston k covey erik larson s even handed article on paxton quigley armed force wsj cites the world s most notorious statistic regarding guns in the home a pioneering study of residential gunshot deaths in king county washington found that a gun in the home was times more likely to be used to kill its owner spouse a friend or child than to kill an intruder the times stat is everywhere these days it has grown in media lore like the proverbial urban myth it was inflated by one pugilistic talk show pundit to given the shock value of the finding the conclusion of the new england journal of medicine nejm study is remarkably understated the advisability of keeping firearms in the home for protection must be questioned responsible people should indeed question the risks and benefits of bringing a firearm into their home but what we need to know is this what exactly are the risks and benefits the nejm testimony is neither the whole truth about the benefits nor nothing but the truth about the risks further as with motor vehicles we want to know what control do we have over the risks and benefits and as with the risks of cancer or heart disease or auto accidents how can we minimize the risks like raw highway death tolls the nejm stat is not very helpful here the nejm finding purports to inform us but it is framed to warn us off it is widely promulgated in the media as a scare stat a misleading half truth whose very formulation is calculated to prejudice and terrify the frightful statistic screams for itself the risks far outweigh the benefits yes what fool would run these risks if your car were times more likely to kill you a loved one a dear friend or an innocent child than to get you to your destination should you not take the bus uncritical citation puts the good name of statistics in the bad company of lies and damned lies surely we can do better where lives are at stake let s take a closer look at this risky business the times stat of the nejm study is the product of dividing the number of home intruders aggressors justifiably killed in self defense the divisor into the number of family members or acquaintances killed by a gun in the home the dividend the divisor of this risk equation is in the study s five year sample there were intruders and other cases of self defense the dividend is in the study there were accidental deaths criminal homicides and suicides divided by yields there were a total of gun related deaths in king county between and so the study leaves deaths outside of homes unaccounted the nejm s notorious times statistic is seriously misleading on six counts the dividend is misleadingly characterized in the media the or acquaintances of the study who include your friendly drug dealers and neighborhood gang members is equated to friends the implication is that the offending guns target and kill only beloved family members dear friends and innocent children deaths may all be equally tragic but the character and circumstance of both victims and killers are relevant to the risk these crucial risk factors are masked by the calculated impression that the death toll is generated by witless waltons shooting dear friends and friendly neighbors this is criminological hogwash the study itself does not distinguish households or environs populated by people with violent criminal or substance abuse histories where the risk of death is very high versus households inhabited by more civil folk for example people who avoid high risk activities like drug dealing gang banging and wife beating where the risk is very low indeed in actuality negligent adults allow fatal but avoidable accidents and homicides are perpetrated mostly by people with histories of violence or abuse people who are identifiably and certifiably at high risk for misadventure to ignore these obvious risk factors in firearm accidents and homicides is as misleading as ignoring the role of alcohol in vehicular deaths by tautology neither gun deaths nor vehicular deaths would occur without firearms or vehicles but the person and circumstance of the gun owner or driver crucially affect the risk one misleading implication of the way the nejm stat is framed is that the mere presence of a gun in the home is much more likely to kill than to protect and this obscures indeed disregards the role of personal responsibility the typical quotation of this study unlike larson s attributes fatal agency to the gun a gun in the home is times as likely to kill the center to prevent handgun violence a major promulgator of the nejm statistic uses this particular formulation we can dispense with the silly debate about whether it s people or guns that accomplish the killing again by tautology gun deaths would not occur without the guns the question begged is how many deaths would occur anyway without the guns in any case people are the death dealing agents the guns are their lethal instruments the moral core of the personal risk factors in gun deaths are personal responsibility and choice due care and responsibility obviate gun accidents human choice mediates homicide and suicide by gun or otherwise the choice to own a gun need not condemn a person to nejm s high risk pool the gun does not create this risk by itself people have a lot to say about what risk they run with guns in their homes for example graduates of paxton quigley s personal protection course do not run the touted times risk any more than skilled and sober drivers run the same risks of causing or suffering vehicular death as do reckless or drunk drivers undiscriminating actuarials disregard and obscure the role of personal responsibility and choice just as they disregard and obscure the role of socio economic criminological and other risk relevant factors in firearm related death this is why we resent insurance premiums and actuarial consigment to risk pools whose norms disregard our individualities fortunately nothing can consign us to the nejm risk pool but our own lack of choice or responsibility in the matter suicide accounts for of the deaths by gun in the home in the nejm study as against the total deaths by gun in king county including those outside the home in house suicides are of the total death toll which is closer to the roughly proportion found by other studies suicide is a social problem of a very different order from homicide or accidents the implication of the nejm study is that these suicides might not occur without readily available guns it is true that attempted suicide by gun is likely to succeed it is not obviously true that the absence of a gun would prevent any or all of these suicides this is widely assumed or alleged but the preponderance of research on guns and suicide actually shows otherwise that this is wishful thinking in all but a few truly impulsive cases see bruce l danto et al the human side of homicide columbia university press charles rich et al guns and suicide american journal of psychiatry march if suicides were removed from the dividend of the nejm study s risk equation the times stat would deflate to six the inclusion of suicides in the nejm risk equation like the causes durability or interdiction of suicidal intent itself is a profoundly debatable matter quotations of the nejm study totally disregard this issue citations of the nejm study also mislead regarding the estimable rate of justifiable and excusable homicide most measures like the nejm homicide rate are based on the immediate disposition of cases but many homicides initially ruled criminal are appealed and later ruled self defense in the literature on battered women immediate case dispositions are notorious for under representing the rate of justifiable or excusable homicide time s january cover story on women fighting back reported one study s finding that of women who appeal have their murder convictions thrown out time s july cover story on a week of gun deaths reported of the domestic cases as shootings by abuse victims but only of the homicides were reported as self defense in a may update time reported that of the homicides had eventually been ruled self defense in time s sample the originally reported rate of self defense was in error by a factor of four the possibility of such error is not acknowledged by promulgators of the nejm statistic while both the dividend and the product of the nejm risk equation are arguably inflated the divisor is unconscionably misleading the divisor of this equation counts only aggressors who are killed not aggressors who are successfully thwarted without being killed or even shot at the utility of armed self defense is the other side of the coin from the harms done with guns in homes what kind of moral idiocy is it to measure this utility only in terms of killings do we measure the utility of our police solely in terms of felons killed as opposed to the many many more who are otherwise foiled apprehended or deterred should we not celebrate let alone count those cases where no human life is lost as successful armed defenses the question posed to media that cite the nejm scare stat is this why neglect the compendious research on successful armed defense notably by criminologist gary kleck point blank guns and violence in america aldine de gruyter kleck s estimations of the rate and risk of defensive firearm use are based on victimization surveys as well as other studies the rate is high about one million a year and the risk is good gun defenders fare better than anyone either those who resort to other forms of resistance or those who do not resist dividing one million gun defenses a year by annual gun deaths from self defense homicides suicides and accidents yields thus we can construct a much more favorable statistic than the nejm scare stat a gun is times more likely to be used to defend against assault or other crime than to kill anybody of course kleck s critics belittle the dividend of this calculation what is good news for gun defenders is bad news for gun control we should indeed question the basis and method of kleck s high estimation of defensive firearm use as i have questioned the nejm statistic clearly the issue of how to manage mortal risks is not settled by uncritical citation of statistics one thing troubles me still we can hardly escape the unquestioned nejm scare stat in our media but we hardly ever find kleck s good work mentioned even critically larry cipriani l v cipriani att com

happened had the people come out with their hands up several weeks ago it didn t happen and who is responsible for it not happening certainly not the children koresh was calling the shots he was talking with his lawyer and the fbi since others were released safely there is no sane reason for keeping the children inside the compound the fbi and koresh were calling the shots and there were very sane reasons for keeping the children if they let them go the parents would never see them again that is not an easy choice in spite of you cold attitude about it scenario that is simplest and most plausible i do not generally believe in conspiracy theories that involve complicated and unlikely scenarios the fbi sent letters to martin luther king s wife insinuating that mlk was having an affair again please tell us exactly how much you trust our supposedly benevolent government more than someone who would not release children from the compound obviously you are an authority worshiper not at all are you a koresh worshiper i am a constitution worshiper you quite obviously eat anything the authorities feed you without doubt which makes you no different that a koresh worshiper i e more than david koresh vernon howell jesus christ i saw lengthy excerpts from an australian documentary made in that clearly showed that this was a cult give me a camera and time with you and i can present excerpts that show you to be a cult leader guarenteed thanks for my laugh of the day definitely a very silly supposition if you do not believe this you are truly naive it is not only possible it is easy i worked in the broadcast profession at a network station in the late s i know what i m saying here embarrasing footage is easy to get add a little sinister music and the right voice over and i ll have you mother agreeing to commit you you should at least view the whole documentary before you claim it as a source i would if i could the news show that showed the lengthy excerpts also had interviews with the filmmaker who made the documentary who basically confirmed what was shown in the excerpts from the time he spent at the compound in the news shows were looking for excerpts which backed their position do you think they would show excerpts which disproved their points i am not pleased with the batf handling of the affair i think they bungled it badly from the start but i don t think they are responsible for the fire which started in two different places two places eh you saw this or did the wonderful fbi tell you this i saw one place i believe that this was reported by local radio reporters on site a fire started in a three story tower at the same time as the two story window shown on the tv coverage the reports of multi starts came solely from the fbi anyone observing the fire from the available video would be hard pressed to see more than one point of fire which spread across the compound as a uniform rate the batf is by no means devoid of fault in the handling of this affair but to suggest that they may have intentionally started the fire is ludicrous i suspect that there were plenty of camerapeople willing to risk small arms fire to get some good footage these people were told to get the hell out of camera range why couldn t answer this one eh this is the most important question of all it is the root cause of all the other suspicion i thought about mentioning how reagan and the military treated the press in grenada and how that set the precedent but decided it wasn t worthy of discussion if the news reporter got shot you can bet his family would sue the government for letting him into the danger area no reported has ever sued the government for such a situation they know the dangers remember the batf invited the initial coverage and how about a simple remote controlled camera or two there were ways to provide media access the fbi obviously just didn t want any the root cause of suspicion in my mind is why people wouldn t flee a building that had numerous exits during the minutes time it took to burn down or why didn t they flee hours earlier when the tear gas was first introduced i can find no rational explanation for their behavior i can find several tear gas and smoke making it impossible to remove the barricades flames blocking exits to the saferooms perhaps the gun shots were from the fbi keeping them pinned in who

4789###talk.politics.guns###re wi and il firearms law questions question as i understand it in evanston il they have a ordinance banning handguns is there any way to get around this provision why don t you call the city and ask oak park also has an illegal handgun ban as well but does allow those with a collectors ffl to possess collectible handguns what would the penalty if you were found out be probably a fine in practical terms what if you used said handgun in a defensive shooting in your apartment there how would the city law apply to your impending trial for the shooting it wouldn t impede your defense at all there was an actual incident in oak park where a gas station owner engaged in a shootout with a handgun the grand jury decided not to presecute on the other hand a black man used an illegally owned handgun in oak park to defend himself and the village tried to make an example out of him an nra director who lived there made a stink about this and it was decided not to charge the guy of course pissing off anti gun police thugs has it s own drawbacks like when the oak park police chief came to his house and told him this is stepping over the line this could get dangerous for you whereupon the few black oak park police officers watched over his house to ensure that the white anti gun police chief and his anti gun cronies wouldn t f ck with him his home or family also what is il state law concerning short barreled weapons short barreled shotgun is what i would be interested in if a handgun were not available either that or a shortened mm carbine ie colt marlin l v cipriani states that the any other weapon category is allowed but the exact relationship between an ithaca auto burgular which i believe is in the any other weapon category and a chopped barrel h k hk class for sure is not clear to me one more thing what is the chance of getting a ccw permit in il without being rich or famous or related to the mayor in your dreams buddy as long as democrats reign in chicago illinois residents will always be disarmed and helpless in the streets politicians get around this by provisions in the law that allow them to carry concealed weapons voters in chicago are too stupid to vote these a holes out of office because the dems are always in power the illinois supreme court is always tilted to the democratic party s views on guns all candidates supported by political consultant david axelrod are anti gun which explains anti rkba crook county states attorney jack ass o malley being a so called republican get rid of the chicago democrats get rid of their members on the il judiciary and you got a fighting chance of a preemption law and a ccw law

an anonymous ftp archive directory for rkba related information this directory can be used for things like articles by kates wright tonso levinson supreme court decisions the ria vs us decision copies of legislation and so on it s not meant to be for the discussions that normally appear here so in the future if you re looking for something check there first and then ask here instructions short version for techies the site is godiva nectar cs cmu edu place contributions into the directory usr anon pub firearms politics rkba the ftp commands get put mget or mput should work give the command type binary to be sure files are transferred correctly your files will be moved to the rkba directory to get a file use the commands get or mget i will maintain an index which you should get first to check if the file you want to read or write already is archived long version for non techies in order for you to use this archive your computer must be on the internet to connect to the archive site run the command ftp godiva nectar cs cmu edu if that doesn t work you cannot use this archive if the ftp command is successful you ll get this prompt asking you for a login name godiva nectar cs cmu edu lvc instead of lvc your initials will appear answer this prompt with ftp next you ll get this prompt asking your for your e mail address guest login ok send e mail address as password i would enter l v cipriani att com you ll enter your own e mail address you ll get these lines or similar as output remote system is unix using binary mode to transfer files next the command prompt is printed ftp if you do not get the line using binary mode to transfer files run the command type binary now you re logged in to the archive machine there are many directories on this machine but the two you are concerned with are usr anon pub firearms politics rkba and usr anon pub firearms politics incoming there are subdirectories to the rkba directory those are discussed below when you login to the system your directory is usr anon to retreive files change your current directory to the rkba directory with the command cd usr anon pub firearms politics rkba or cd pub firearms politics rkba to submit files change your directory to the incoming directory with the command cd usr anon pub firearms politics incoming or cd pub firearms politics incoming once you do this you ll get another ftp prompt asking you to enter another command to find the names of the existing files in the directory you are in run the command ls l this will produce something like total r r r karl jun dmn gratia ccp r r r karl apr index r r r karl jun knox aw lies r r r karl apr s r r r karl jun wsj crimestrike r r r karl jan academia bias r r r karl mar academics r r r karl aug aclu and so on each line corresponds to one file reading right to left the fields are the file name the last modification date of the file the size of the file in bytes and some permission fields which you do not need to be concerned with to get a file run the command get followed by the name of the file you want for example get index or get noduty after the file is transfered to your machine a message like this transfer complete bytes received in seconds kbytes s you can repeat the get command for every file you want to retreive you can use the mget command to retreive multiple files if the file you want is in a subdirectory for example congress rd hr you should change your directory to the appropriate subdirectory first and then retrieve it cd congress rd get hr once you re finished you can log off with the command quit if you have a file you want to contribute the procedure is a little different first of all you should find out if the file already exists so get a copy of the index file with the procedure above and look it over to make sure you wouldn t repeat an entry the index will have a description of each of the files in the rkba directory for example file whitemanslaw white man s law by william r tonso from the december reason magazine once you ve determined you won t be duplicating an entry login and change to the incoming directory command see above once you are in the incoming directory use the command put file name in this case put whitemanslaw again there ll be a transfer complete so many bytes transfered in so many seconds message now your file is on the archive machine another thing to watch out for is duplicate file names be sure there isn t a file in the incoming directory that is called the same as the file you want to write if you use the same name you ll overwrite the previous file or you ll get an error message your file may have to be renamed if there is a conflict with a file by the same name in the rkba directory once your file is in the incoming directory send me an entry for the index file and i will add it to the file if you cannot use anonymous ftp and would still like to contribute a file email the file to me and i ll take care of the rest if you submit a file and do not notify me it may be removed so be sure to let me know first if you have any questions feel free to ask me larry cipriani l v cipriani att com michael phelps

4792###talk.politics.guns###re my gun is like my american express card in article cmm thomasp surt ifi uio no thomas parsli thomasp ifi uio no writes gun clubs if you are a member you can borrow weapons suprised you are supposed to train with a for the months then you can start with anything bigger drivers licence forgot that usa is the land of cars getting one in scandinavia and northern europe is not easy average time is about hours of training and the cost is rather but we think this is acceptable because a car is not a toy and bad drivers tend to hurt others if you are really bad you won t get a lincence abuse by the goverment this seems to be one of the main problems any harder gun control would just be abused by the goverment either some of you are a little paranoid no offence or you should get a new goverment you do have elections unfortunately elections can and are bought promise the voters money and they will vote for you guns n criminals most weapons used by criminals today are stolen known criminals can not buy weapons that s one of the points of gun control same here convicted felons may not legally purchase firearms and because gun control are strict in whole scandinavia and most of europe we dont have any problem with smuggled guns that you know of while i lived in the dbr a gang robbed a joint us army bundewehr armoury and got several hundred m s ammunition handguns and some explosives when i left two years later there were no clues mixing weapons and things that can be use as one what i meant was that cars can kill but they are not guns someone said that if we ban guns we d have to ban cars to because they kill to i don t think we should argue on this one the issue i hope i think we all agree that the criminals are the main problem guns are not a problem but the way they are used is and what are they for who uses them is the problem crime in the u s is no big deal if you are the criminal how about years for murder credit for time served in jail waiting for trial and you are out in months worst case if we would put criminals especially violent ones in the slam for true sentences crime would drop instead we reward them for being good and let them out early very early i think this discusion is interesting when you think of ex jugoslavia they should all have weapons it s their rigth to have them and if they use them to kill other innocent people the problem is humans not guns serbs croats and muslims have been killing each other almost since before the invention of guns old women are throwing stones at un trucks this is a hatred that goes beyond reason if of all murders was done with axes would you impose some regulations on them or just say that they are ment to be used at trees and that the axe is not a problem it s the axer an example don t flame me just because not exactly are killed by guns yes the problem is the user question back since you are one of the rational ones if all gun crime were to stop would you support dropping all gun controls think about the situation in los angeles where people are buying guns to protect themselves is this a good situation is it the rigth way to deal with the problem they did not believe from experience that the police including national guard could would protect them unless you want to argue that a human being does not have a right to protect him herself they did the right thing what would you suggest as a defense against a mob throwing bottles and rocks and also likely armed with stolen firearms if everybody buys guns to protect themselves from criminals and their neighbor who have guns what do you think will happen i mean if everybody had a gun in usa criminals would move to scandinavia the average criminal would look for a less hazardous job and the rest would likely be buried at county expense don t flame the englishmen because of northern irland they have gun control that works in england and fonds from usa are one of the reasons why ira can bomb innocents something about throwing stones in glass houses personally i criticize the fools who send money to the ira to make ireland free of course this is the last thing the ira wants because they lose power if england pulls out but that s for another group don t flame them because of what to three children did either the u s has roughly times the major sporting events as the u k how many riots did we have at sporting events last year off the playing field hooligan is a word never used when reffering to sports fans here i guess that s where the different cultures thing comes in can an jugoslav have an oppinion on guns or even peace yes yes the question is is the problem one of too many guns mostly from the army or not enough nonserbians can not defend themselves my numbers about crime rates after restrictions on shot guns are from the police and the statistisk sentralbyraa understood that one sorenson last word responsible gun owners are not a problem but they

4796###talk.politics.guns###re jffo has gone a bit too far having read the posted long article by jpfo i have some observations this article does not claim that the gca of is a verbatim translation of a nazi law what it says is that in another place the book they re talking about they compare the two things section by section the implication is that the similarities are devastating in the next sentence they talk about how in that book they reproduce the german text of the nazi law together with its translation not surprisingly a reader could easily conflate these two things into a single idea that the american gca is a literal translation of the nazi law and sure enough that s what the whole thing has mutated into urban folklore style the article goes to great pains to establish that senator dodd had a copy of the nazi law either from his time on the nurnberg prosecution team or later this fact is considered highly incriminating but i don t understand why the author repeats several times that he is simply unable to imagine how anyone could come into possession of the original text and yet in a paragraph towards the end he explains it perfectly if dodd got his copy of the original german text of the nazi weapons law during his time at nurnberg it likely was part of a collection of documents for example issues of the reichsgesetzblatt the german law registry bingo exactly dodd had a book with a series of nazi laws in it including the one under discussion all of the stuff about why would a u s congressman have a copy of a nazi law melts away by the author s admission he then continues but if he acquired the original german text of the nazi weapons law after his service at nurnberg he must have done so for a very specific reason but there s absolutely no reason to think that this is the case in fact as a senior member of the u s team that helped to prosecute nazi war criminals it seems to me that he would have had to have a copy all arguments about whether the nazi weapon law is really of historical interest as it obviously is certainly according to the author here or whether dodd personally prosecuted the interior minister who signed it can be put aside as red herrings having established that dodd owned a copy of the original german text the jpfo article then tries to draw sinister implications from the fact that he asked to have it translated the problem is in the context of the charge levelled at dodd these two things work against each other people ask to have things translated when they don t know what they mean if dodd took it upon himself to preserve the nazi law with idea of someday introducing it into american law surely by he would have know what it meant wouldn t he anyway this precise charge the main one that i questioned in an earlier posting is just silly why would dodd need the exact translation for this purpose is the idea that the gun controllers despite being presumably bent on disarming the populace with the goal of eventually destroying all civil liberties needed a crib sheet didn t they have any idea how to do it on their own once again the author provides a perfectly acceptable answer to his own question dodd may have offered his copy of the nazi weapons law to show that the specific proposal did not resemble anything in the nazi law in fact since the law and its translation were entered into the congressional record under the heading of documents concerning the history of nazism and gun confiscation dodd s motivation isn t a mystery he asked for the translation in order to put it in the cr even this article makes it clear that the part of the nazi law that was added by the nazi regime is only a small part of that law registration of guns for instance was begun in and thus not a nazi inspired idea the parts of the nazi law that parallel the gca include handgun control of some sort and the identification of certain weapons as sporting weapons the jpfo then goes on to list other parts of the nazi law forbidding ownership of weapons by jews of course there are no such provisions in the american gca nevertheless in a rhetorical move guaranteed to muddy the waters immediately after the discussion of the anti jewish parts of the law the jpfo article continues given the parallels between the nazi weapons law and the gca so as to get maximum emotional mileage out of that aspect of the law don porges porges inmet camb inmet com uunet inmet porges

this is not so you can shoot cardboard cut outs down at the range in fact there are both guns and bullets designed specifically for that the idea that my ruger mark ii bull barrel a semi auto caliber handgun was designed to kill or hurt people even for self defense would i m sure come as a surprise to its designer it certainly isn t why i have it it certainly would hurt someone if you shot them with it and might even kill them but it is simply wrong to say it was designed to kill people this is not designed to act as a tool for home defence where you show someone that you have a gun and they go gee perhaps i should leave in fact that is what happens most of the time most self defensive uses of firearms don t involve firing any shots most criminals would prefer not to be shot and will go to some effort not to be including doing what you say when you point a gun at them if you were called on to design a tool that could be easily carried to immediately stop someone attacking you what would it be a handgun is about the best anyone has come up with and experience shows it does work the best no you see the gun was designed to fire that little bullet into a human body and hurt them not a tough concept to swallow for most certainly no one argues that handguns of the type we are discussing aren t deadly weapons however it simply isn t true to say that all of them were designed to kill people moreover what exactly is wrong with having deadly weapons there are times when it is perfectly legitimate to use deadly force e g in self defense i consider it not just my right but my duty to defend myself and my family and that includes having and knowing how to use the tools to do that the strongest reason for the people to retain the right to keep and bear arms is as a last resort to protect themselves against tyranny in government t jefferson i think what jefferson said is still true and the trouble with having such an item is often the little bullet goes off into the wrong fleshy target not very often compared to other use or else uncle frank gets pissed and blows away his wife this isn t that common either at least when compared to other uses it is very rare that a non violent person will suddenly get pissed and kill someone gun or not in most cases the people who murder have long histories of violence if you have good reason to believe that these people wouldn t kill if they didn t have a gun feel free to present it having a thing specificly designed to kill means it is much easier to kill things right right but there are times when killing things is called for i hope i never have to shoot a person but i ve had to kill a number of animals from rodents to cows and when i do i don t want them to suffer any more than is necessary i prefer they die instantly but failing that i want them to drop so i can quickly finish them with the next shot and failing that i don t want them to go fast or far i try to choose the best weapon and ammunition i have to try to achieve that goal for the size of animal i m after but it doesn t always work as i plan without belaboring the point people who are overly impressed with the killing or shopping power of guns particularly handguns haven t used them much for that purpose accidental deaths in deaths by auto deaths by fall deaths by drowning deaths by fire deaths by poison deaths by food deaths by
