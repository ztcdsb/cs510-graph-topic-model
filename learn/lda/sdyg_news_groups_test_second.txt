has violated system integrity close all applications exit windows and restart your computer error gawd i love windows is there an easy way to restore everything to working order what might be some better approaches you ll probably want to delete any damaged executables and reload them fresh data files should be examined and repaired what might have caused this does the smartdrv cache make me more vulnerable i m suspicious of hard drive caches especially when they cache data writing you re not stupid smartdrive caches things and windows also runs a swap file which may contain data also all of this is pretty risky stuff in a pc environment the straightforward approach would be to run chkdsk with the f option to fix the disk and then it looks like i would probably have to reinstall windows and a few other things a reasonably accurate prediction here s a brief description of how dos stores files there are three pieces to a file the directory entry the fat chain and the data area you can think of these as a sheet of lined notebook paper a sheet of graph paper and a stack of x cards the directory entry notebook paper holds the file name actual size and first cluster number it also holds some other information that s not important right now the file allocation table fat chain graph paper tells where to find the actual data each square of graph paper holds a number if the number is zero the cluster associated with this box is available if it holds a magic number it is either the last piece of a file or a bad unuseable spot on the disk any other number tells which cluster contains the next section of the file the data area x cards is where the actual information is stored the data area is organized as clusters of a fixed size storage is doled out in chunks of one cluster each in your case one cluster is bytes as a cluster is filled another is allocated to read a file you first look at the directory entry to get the starting cluster number now you read the data from that cluster next look at the fat entry for the cluster you just read this will tell you the cluster number for the next chunk of the file naturally these numbers are usually sequential but they can jump around and even go backwards continue reading one cluster at a time as you walk this chain through the fat until you hit the marker which says it s the last cluster in the file chkdsk is the dos utility that checks the sanity and coherence of the directories and the fat and can bludgeon most flaws into submission it doesn t have any intelligence so you have to double check anything it fixes now let s do a bit of a post mortem c gfx vpic cvpic exe c gfx vpic vpic txt c gfx vpic video cfg c gfx vpic orcpro cfg c gfx vpic vga cfg c game goose bird x c winmisc adv winadv exe allocation error size adjusted all of these files have sizes according to the fat which don t match the size reported in their directory entries chkdsk f will alter the directory entries to match the fat size in other words the directory entry for cvpic exe may say the file is bytes long but chkdsk found a fat chain of clusters attached to it my numbers obviously are made up lost allocation units found in chains bytes disk space would be freed disk space was found which is allocated in the fat but is not attached to any directory entry chkdsk f gives you the option of converting these lost chains to files you can then examine the files file chk through file chk and rename or discard them or if you tell chkdsk not to convert them to files then those clusters will simply be marked available in the fat c gfx vpic cvpic exe is cross linked on allocation unit c spart par is cross linked on allocation unit these files are both referencing the same data cluster obviously one of them at least must be wrong it s interesting to note that c spart par is your windows swap file to fix this you should copy each cross linked file to a new name this will fix the cross link by giving the files unique data spaces now delete the cross linked files examine the copies and try to assemble them properly good luck hint missing pieces are likely to be found in those lost chains at the top bytes total disk space bytes in hidden files bytes in directories bytes in user files bytes available on disk your disk is pretty close to full this may be the actual cause of the problem perhaps windows needed to expand its swapfile by an amount which exceeded available disk space in any case the short summary is that something trashed your fat there are utilities that can mirror your fat and help repair damage after something like this but you have to run them before the problem occurs sorry gordon s hlavenka cgordon vpnet chi il us vote straight ticket procrastination party dec rd gordon s hlavenka

2500###comp.os.ms-windows.misc###summary borland microsoft database c libraries well i m amazed at how successful this exercise was i received responses and requests for summary thanks to everyone who made it possible on my own i was able to find out about codebase accsys and q e codebase and accsys are c libraries without sql q e is a windows application that can be communicated through windows dde calls where you send a sql string and receive the results most people wrote to tell me about the paradox engine from borland other products mentioned were microsoft s odbc accsys quadbase codebase rbase and q e only odbc quadbase rbase and q e have sql for myself i decided on codebase mostly because it has an ansi c portability version that runs under dos unix etc and includes the source code and portability is important in my application it works with dbase foxpro or clipper files however i feel that microsoft s odbc looks very promising it s mostly a formalisation of building and submitting sql queries and formatting query results as the responses say it s available via ftp except it s effectively unusuable without two manuals the odbc programmer s reference and the odbc sdk guide moreover odbc doesn t actually interpret sql and liase with databases that s up to drivers that should be provided by database manufacturers also it s windows only it s actually an extension to the windows sdk nevertheless it s a start at a sql interface standard and should make life interesting in the future here s my original post followed by the responses separated by a line of asterisks does anyone know if borland or microsoft have libraries for accessing their respective databases paradox foxpro from within c programs i d really like to be able to build a sql query string and pass it to a function which returns the query results in some format failing that any other access would still be better than nothing i d also like to hear of third party libraries for doing the same thing if other people are interested i ll prepare a summary of what i m told and post it thanks to all borland has a product called paradox engine that does just what you want the current version is which is fully compatible with ack paradox why the versions are different i don t know pd engine was compatible with pdox and it consists of a rather broad library of functions for accesing database files from both pascal i think turbo pascal and up and c i think either microsoft or borland now reading the box it s borland paradox engine database frameworks works with any borland c c mocrosoft c or later turbo c for windows turbo pascal or later tp for windows or later for framework applications bc or later or ms c c it does have support for object useage i haven t had a real chance to really

anything besides simple retrieval and inserts updates i m currently using it i have an eval copy and i ve linked it in to some entry screens i ve written the engine library adds about k to the size of

year or even next year they are trying to get thrid parties to help out if you have any other questions let me know mike kamlet mike vpnet chi il us yes borland sells their paradox engine separately

chris from fernand slinky cs nyu edu christopher fernandes borland sells their paradox engine it s a library of functions for accessing paradox db files it comes with libraries for ms c bcc turbo pascal v and i believe it comes with turbo pascal win libraries as well the c libraries come in both dos and windows flavors the win stuff being dll s when i got it it also came with crystal reports which is a graphical report generator it allows you to create a generic form and use it within a compiled program using pdox engine i don t know if they still offer it or what the current price is i

forecast calls for thunder t bird sc it s a hell of a thing killing a man you take away all he has and all he s ever gonna have will munny unforgiven i am beyond the under age group but i have an experience a few years ago that might be interesting to you i owned a toyota celica gt i decided to buy myself a gift a more exotic car front runners included the toyota supra turbo and the porsche model years i narrowed it down to those two i liked the simplicity and handling and snob appeal too of driving a porsche the supra turbo was less money and had more features and performance almost a personal luxury car it had better acceleration and a higher top speed than the i was almost ready to give in to a buying impulse for the but i decided to stop by my insurance agent s office on the way i asked about what would happen to my rate with either car if you buy the supra your rate classification will be the same as the celica the celica was considered a subcompact and for that year was rated as one of the safest cars with a slight increase because the car will be years newer our lower risk division will continue to handle your account if you buy the porsche we ll have to change you to the standard higher rate company and your rate will double and if you go with a it s another story again we ll cover the rest of this year but cancel you after that but the supra is much faster than the and the is actually faster than the standard that doens t make sense that s what the book says we don t insure corvettes either for some reason the underwriters consider supras and their drivers as very traditional and conservative i eventually went with the supra for a number of reasons the porsche dealer had a nice salesman to get me interested but a tough high pressure guy in the back room at equal monthly payments it would have taken a year longer to pay for the porsche plus its higher insurance i concluded that the high insurance was related to probability of auto theft everyone s entitled to my opinion goldberg oasys dt navy mil imagination is more important than knowledge albert einstein i live in idaho when i was many years ago years i bought a trans am new insurance was about year when i turned it immediately dropped to year i had not had any accidents before or after this was strictly an age change that same rate stayed pretty much the same until i

probe ala how they do in the long run repair records reliability mileage etc i am fixing to buy a car in the next few months aiming toward something a little bigger than a typical small car and with a little more power i am considering the mx probe accord corolla and the sx i bought a probe gt with the pep a last july now at miles after debating over the sentra se r nx mx mr stealth prelude and celica the car design is different than earlier years so it s too early to see its reliability so far for what it s worth my comments my dislikes shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal some other owners on the ford probe world std com mailing list have commented about this problem but i haven t seen it happen on my month old probe gt i think this may be something that ford has corrected since the initial batch of cars also someone said that ford has issued a service bulletin to inform dealers about how to correct this problem so you may be able to get your dealer to fix it headlights have stuck up a few times weather air conditioning broke miles pressure cycling switch condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn t drain completely haven t seen any of these problems nor have i seen these mentioned on the mailing list so these might just be having bad luck with these crammed engine little hope for do it yourselfers typical definitely parts somewhat more expensive than normal ford parts underside plastic doesn t like sharp driveways and speedbumps typical assembly gripes tape on radiator screw fell out of dash seat seams not stitched properly hopefully just a fluke no problems like these either i haven t been able to find any obvious places where they screwed up ford only gives key with the car c mon ford spend an extra few pennies hmmm i got two keys with my car something tells me you got stiffed by your dealer on this actually if you count the credit card key that came in the owner s binder i got keys but since the credit card key doesn t have any teeth cut in it yet i guess i won t count it rear hatch has no padding on corners when up i m waiting for the day when i bash my head on the corner horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference the latter is probably because of the air bag it s pretty much takes up all the space where you d expect to find the horn speaking of the horn i was surprised to find that the probe comes with one of those nice merican sounding horns instead of the japanese sounding kind the previous probes had japanese horns tires fling dirt mud onto side of car yeah not very badly but enough to be annoying sometimes my likes engine design valves sounds smoothness power mileage torque definitely handling very good for fwd understeer only at limits transmission the speed is a must usable instrumentation lovely readable analog everywhere very little torque steer at full power much better than the sho i drive stability at mph high gearing though low cowl good visibility in front heated outside mirrors nice in fog never tested in freezing weather abs air bag see above rear seats fold down i have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important no shake rattle noises when going over bumps potholes still tires vr goodyear eagles left hoping for k i agree strongly with all of the above especially about the engine the interior is very very nice too very pleasing to the eye and ergonomically sound i drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads and most noticable thing is that the probe s suspension doesn t like potholes when you test drive one find a potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable yes this car s stiff suspension isn t for everyone i personally like it but if you find it a little harsh but otherwise like the car i d strongly suggest looking into the mx if you have passengers by all means bring them along too they ll find that they have no room in the back and you ll find that the car rides differently if that s better is up to you the problem with the back seat is that there s no leg room plenty of head room though shorter people fit back there without any complaints so long as the seat they are sitting behind is pulled forward a bit to give them a place to put their feet also there s a lot of glass around you which i wasn t expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer my back seat passengers now very few complain about the lack of ventilation you may want to consider that when combined with the heat the power moonroof can greatly improve the ventilation throughout the car i really enjoy the moonroof by the way but then i ve always been a sucker for open air driving no leakage problems or anything like that yet i ve heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine i haven t heard about this one i know that some of the very early probes and maybe had problems with prematurely rusting mufflers which ford will replace at no charge but i haven t heard about anything like this concerning the probes i haven t had any real trouble with this car outside of a cv joint boot that was leaking but the dealer took care of that promptly and even gave me a free rental car for the day and a half that i was without my car i was quite happy with the way they handled especially considering that i was expecting the worst from them from what i ve heard it sounds like ford mazda had some qc problems with the probe and probably mx when they first went into production but i think these problems have mostly been corrected at this point that s almost always to be expected with a completely new car like this though hope this helps chuck chuck kesler internet chuck eos ncsu edu unix systems

reliability mileage etc i am fixing to buy a car in the next few months aiming toward something a little bigger than a typical small car and with a little more power i am considering the mx probe accord corolla and the sx the probe is the youngest of the bunch thus my interest in opinions but every magazine and ratings book places it as an excellent value btw the sx is rear wheel drive and is due for a re design for thanks in advance while i don t read normally read this group i was looking for valentine radar information sigh maybe in the faq and came across your posting i bought a probe gt with the pep a last july now at miles after debating over the sentra se r nx mx mr stealth prelude and celica check this month s consumer reports for previous probe records my criteria a fun car with abs airbag over hp and less than k i thought about a turbo but checking with insurance people ruled that out the tri star cars eclipse talon etc were out since they don t have an air bag ditto for the mustang also no abs the se r nx m fell into the pocket rocket category a good used car buy the mx was almost there but rolled more than i liked i didn t like the prelude dash instrumentation at all too weird for me the mr has a much smaller non passenger space than i needed so out that went the celica was ok but underpowered when loaded with options and somewhat overpriced too in non turbo form i never considered the sx since it didn t have an airbag i did look at it for its rwd virtues but that s it the corolla never entered my mind i should have looked at the mitsubishi vr dodge stealth more since my list was exhausted i bought the probe the car design is different than earlier years so it s too early to see its reliability so far for what it s worth my comments my dislikes shutting door with windows up from inside rarely makes good wind seal headlights have stuck up a few times weather air conditioning broke miles pressure cycling switch condensation around rear washer fluid container doesn t drain completely crammed engine little hope for do it yourselfers typical parts somewhat more expensive than normal ford parts underside plastic doesn t like sharp driveways and speedbumps typical assembly gripes tape on radiator screw fell out of dash seat seams not stitched properly hopefully just a fluke ford only gives key with the car c mon ford spend an extra few pennies rear hatch has no padding on corners when up i m waiting for the day when i bash my head on the corner horn buttons behind air bag in spokes and not in center personal preference tires fling dirt mud onto side of car my likes engine design valves sounds smoothness power mileage torque definitely handling very good for fwd understeer only at limits transmission the speed is a must usable instrumentation lovely readable analog everywhere very little torque steer at full power much better than the sho i drive stability at mph high gearing though low cowl good visibility in front heated outside mirrors nice in fog never tested in freezing weather abs air bag see above rear seats fold down i have few rear seat passengers so a trunk not important no shake rattle noises when going over bumps potholes still tires vr goodyear eagles left hoping for k as you can see i m primarily interested in the engine while it doesn t have the uummmph of a big liter car or the turbo rush the big selling point for me was the all aluminum value liter engine the overall car is a good buy for the money that market segment hasn t changed much since july prelude vtec honda del sol i drive it to and from work each day on relatively smooth roads and most noticable thing is that the probe s suspension doesn t like potholes when you test drive one find a potholed road somewhere around town and see if the jarring you get is tolerable if you have passengers by all means bring them along too they ll find that they have no room in the back and you ll find that the car rides differently if that s better is up to you also there s a lot of glass around you which i wasn t expecting the temperature inside the car gets pretty hot in the summer my back seat passengers now very few complain about the lack of ventilation you may want to consider that when combined with the heat i ve heard that the exhaust system has trouble but mine works fine leather and the keyless entry system weren t available when i got the car so i can t comment on them i got the car before it was officially announced i prefer cloth to leather anyway i wouldn t want this car in the snow the suspension is too rough for the inevitable surprise potholes tires aren t meant for snow and the seats assume that you re not wearing lots of thick clothing rain is much better water generally beads off the windshield at freeway speed the windshield wiper controls are easy and understandable and i barely hydroplaned once with the eagles and i was really trying there is also a definite lack of cup holder small storage places the gt has map holders below the speakers in the door but they re rigid plastic that could fit two cassettes or cd s max the center console storage bin arm rest has cup holder and the back of the front seats have a cloth pouch but that s it no change holders quite a let down from the sho and the probe is definitely not a people mover car or an econo box car lastly don t store wet car covers in

that i had but know this it s not just the car it is the ability to get the car fixed which will not happen at any chrysler dodge take your pick dealer i don t care if there are going to reform their dealers service with the intro of the lh cars i will believe it when i see it case and point the local dodge dealer you drive up just looking you don t even get out of your door when about yes salesman all eye you like their next meal and literally pounce on you and try to get you to make a deal on everything your eye wanders towards service is about times worse than that i had an alignment problem but they tried to tell me that the k frame was bent and about dollars of work parts to fix it let me tell you the problems i had and i took care of this car i put alot of miles on it in the first couple years but took it to every checkup it needed and many that shouldn t have been dodge shadow es these were replaced within the years that i owned the car engine alternators rear suspension torsion bar water pumps thermostats hall effect sensor main computer batteries these were rebuilt repaired radiator automatic transmission power steering those are just the things i can remember off the top of my head for about a year before i sold the car i said to myself it s a good car i just can t find anybody competent enough the fix it in the end before i traded it in for a saturn the power steering started acting up again i just stopped putting money into it i must have put at least worth of repairs over it s lifetime i am sorry but lee iacocca can bite me bullshit whoever backs em best is just afraid the stupid things are going to fall apart and no one will buy them without assurance why the hell do you think that lh has been nicknamed last hope you can do better and i know people will disagree with me here but japanese like honda or toyota or the only american car company that i feel is a quality product saturn i will not touch another chrysler product again no way i don t care how good the lh cars look good and i will admit they look promising but not with the support that you get gm isn t much better thank god they don t control saturn like they do their divisions or it would be just another marketing ploy don t get me wrong i will be watching my car which i do like like a hawk for the next years i am much more hesitant to say it or any car is really good until it has proved itself to me but since someone else pointed out c d as a source i will note because i used to read these magazines that car and driver has never had a good thing to say about most chrysler products shadow for one always were they moaning about the reguritated k car and engine whereas motor trend always thought they were great cars no car magazine is really objective and although there are alot of people who don t like consumers reports i will use them to reinforce my argument i already know about the big stink with the saturn crash tests time will tell how good a car they are the shadow sundance rate much worse than average in fact none of the chrysler s rate a better than average i think the best one is just average excluding the diamond star mitsubishi stuff and the lh s you can find bad stuff about the shadow try as i might when i researched the saturn i could not find anything bad about it there is a great deal of information about this company just because it is a new american company and it has created quite a stir in the automotive community for good reason much more than the introduction of any new model lines of any established company i read an article which had a sub column an i think this imprinted on me more than anything else some big wig in toyota said and i quote we are watching them very closely come on everybody grow up the foreign cars especially the japanese have been kicking our butts for good reason the american car companies could not make a good product or support the customer the way they want these days to set in their ways which is one of the reasons saturn was created they are still struggling because they haven t learned yet they have the ability the workers are not inferior the technology is not out of date but their attitude is and they are just finding this out it s called competition gentleman women if you don t satisfy the demand of the consumer well your out asbestos suit on gaia

dave winfield ho hum is seriously being considered for it as is lee smith ha then why don t we give dave kingman a chance or darrell evans yeah yeah after the hall of fame takes in them it can take in eddie murray and jeff reardon oh yeah dave winfield marginal player guy didn t hit a lick had negligible power was a crap fielder and had no staying power dave winfield now entering his i believe th big league season is still a damn decent hitter admittedly his defense has slipped a great deal but in his prime he had a powerful arm and great range take a look at the stats i don t know where you even begin to make an argument that winfield and kingman are similar players kingman was a one dimension power hitter he couldn t field he ran like an anvil hit for a low average though if i remember right his obp wasn t that hideous and for those who consider such things important was a absolute primo dick eddie murray yup only the best st baseman of the s i know that mvp votes are conducted by mediots but given that he got jobbed out of the mvp he deserved in it seems that he wasn t overrated by the media lee smith hmmmm this one s actually pretty close he s had a s solid dependable career as a closer despite pitching in some nasty parks wrigley fenway i d have to take a closer look at the stats it s been a while but it seems lee arthur is of hof caliber you do make a legitimate point about the hof credentials of relievers simply racking up a lot of saves doesn t mean a whole hell of a lot if you blow a bunch too simply because minnesota and boston and for a month atlanta used reardon as a closer for longer than he should have been one the equalizer has racked up an impressive number of saves no way should homerman be in the hof imho darrell evans nice career actually a bit underrated kinda like ted simmons imho but not a hof er well in any case i am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody giving hall of fame consideration to players that are by today s standards marginal lemme ask you this who the hell playing the game isn t marginal honestly ozzie smith and robin yount don t belong there they re both shortstops that just hung around for a long time big deal let s be a little more selective huh stop handing out these honors so liberally save them for the guys who really deserve it face it if something now wait a goddamn minute here ozzie smith absolutely redefined the position of shortstop his defense was so good that he s won something along the lines of gold gloves again gold gloves are mediot biased and a good argument could be made that larkin deserved one or two of ozzie s more recent awards but usually this is tempered by someone else in the early s getting the gold gloves ozzie deserved earlier in his career ozzie s offense you ask good obp great speed numbers in a park which for most of his career depressed offense admittedly no power cept against tom niedenfuer but still a definite asset offensively yount hits mvp at two different positions uh huh a real stiff his was one of the great years ever by a player in recent memory and probably ranks behind only the peak seasons of wagner and banks as far as ss numbers go he s a clear hof er imho isn t done there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore when certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential candidates the absurdity is apparent gee can these guys even compare to the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan well as far as garvey goes you re right garvey is a mediot candidate pushed because of his winning attitude a minor factor if one at all and his great defense no errors admittedly but the range of a tree stump garvey shouldn t be in the hof skyjack i ve said a lot of nasty things about skyjack in the last year or so but this is mostly in response to mediots and woofers who talk about morris ability to win which is nothing more than morris ability to pitch when toronto to score tons of runs at this point morris is an average pitcher although from his early returns in he may be damned close to done but in all fairness morris was a dominant pitcher in the s for up and down tiger teams while was obviously a great year for detroit the rest of the decade the team was generally in contention but not favorites morris career numbers are quite good and worthy of hof consideration ryan of course but be careful i guarantee you that someone will throw back your earlier logic about yount and smith being shortstops who hung around a long time after all nolan never won a cy damn he s just pitcher who hung around for years his w l record is mediocre of course nolan s a hof er puck probably although he s got to play reasonably well for a few more years years even good ones aren t enough to make the hof most likely that said i believe puckett will make the hof pretty much regardless of how the rest of his career turns out barring something really tragic or sudden he s very popular in the media and with fans and legitimately has been one of the best cf s in the game since he joined the league i ve always liked the guy and i hope he does make it and in the end i think the puck will make it in but really it s too early to sell this debate comes up rather frequently on the net and believe it or not i never tire of it it s an interesting subject here s an off the top of

dave winfield ho hum is seriously being considered for it as is lee smith ha then why don t we give dave kingman a chance or darrell evans yeah yeah after the hall of fame takes in them it can take in eddie murray and jeff reardon i am trying to think how to respond to this without involving personal feeling or perceptions and i can not without having stats to back up my points however i think you approached this the wrong way i believe all of the people mentioned here deserve the hall of fame more than dave kingman does i feel they were all much better players i am not saying i fell they deserve to go but that they would deserve it more imho dave kingman definately not they guy only had a couple of years were he could hit with atleast a respectable averag the rest of his career i do not think he was very feared by pitchers i also do not think he did a lot for the game i mean really i am a met fan he was a met for part of his career and i still would not back him for the hall of fame dave winfield i think so he is feared by pitchers he has had several season where he hit for a respectable average and his production numbers are in my opinion without stats better than kingman s probably by quite a bit i also perceive him to be a leader maybe not as much as some other people but none the less a leader i think he has made substantial contributions to the game of baseball and to society examples of this are some of the charitable things he has done i know some of this from when he was with the yankees i think he the type of player that kids can look up to and while this is definately not the only criteria for the hall of fame i think it deserves some consideration lee smith maybe i would have to see his stats again but he definately would deserve to go before the likes of kingman darrell evans no eddie murray maybe he has had a very good career he is a leader although a silent one he is a good role model are the stats good enough i am not sure but i would once again believe they are much better than kingman s both the average as well as the power numbers but not as good as winfield s just think eddie did not have as much publicity for most of his great years jeff reardon my guess is no but it kind of depends on his numbers off the top of my head i would take lee smith first well in any case i am sick and tired mostly sick of everybody giving hall of fame consideration to players that are by today s standards marginal honestly ozzie smith and robin yount don t belong there they re both shortstops that just hung around for a long time big deal well i strongly disagree here both of these guys deserve it for sure i talked about leadership above both of these guys are leaders and have been instumental in leading their teams to the post season robin does have very good offensive numbers both average and power and ozzie has okay numbers offensively the difference with ozzie is that if you gave him a home run for every run he saved by making an incredible play at shortstop he would have shattered aaron s home run mark by now how many of those great plays saved games how many of those great plays motivated his team to rally and win a game while i believe both of these guys have numbers baseball is about more than numbers or at least winning at baseball is about more than numbers both of these guys are proven stars and belong in the hall of fame as does george brett who also belongs in this class of player let s be a little more selective huh stop handing out these honors so liberally save them for the guys who really deserve it face it if something isn t done there will be little prestige in the hall of fame anymore when certain individuals believe that steve garvey or jack morris are potential candidates the absurdity is apparent gee can these guys even compare to the more likely future hall of famers like kirby puckett or nolan ryan steve garvey i am not sure probably not but i guess i could see someone making a case for him jack morris once again not my first choice but i can see why someone might bring up his name kirby puckett probably the only reason i do not say definately is he still has time left in his career if he continues doing what he has been then my probably will turn into a definately nolan ryan is there really any doubt i think i heard something about him having some records maybe they were not all good i don t know i did not hear any of them just the number he has the numbers he has the contributions to the game and community and he is a great role model i would not say that he is the best pitcher to ever pitch the game probably not even top but he would be the first pitcher i would put in the hall of fame because of his accomplishments no hitters strikeouts respectable numbers even with some weaker teams you can go on and on i really hope he gets all the possible votes so in summing up i have groups those that belong those that probably do but i am not sure and those that i lean towards saying don t belong at least not without my seeing stats and possibly hearing reasons why they should go yes winfield yount brett not in your mail o smith puckett and ryan maybe murray and l smith no reardon garvey morris evans and definately kingman as i said i do not have the stats around so i do not have numbers to back this up these are entirely my opinions based on my perceptions mike q steve

still catching up from spring break but bear with me in the bigs especially when they haven t even played aaa ball we certainly believe this kid is going to be very good some day but there is really no need to rush him especially since we have a mega million dollar staff that is probably well served by a battery mate who is expereienced in game calling and pitcher handling lopez time will come let s give him some time in aaa javy lopez has proven over ab in the minor leagues that he is ready to play in the majors he is not being rushed players who are clearly too good for aa and play behind stiffs at the major league level are wasting their time and may actually have a court case against major league management for keeping them at aaa no maybe i need to improve my writing skills lopez who is very ordinary defensively is not likely to hit so well at age unless lopez is me defensively i m and born to play second base he belongs in the major leagues training what does he have to do to earn a chance maybe not a full time job but at least a couple starts and a few ab for him to prove his worth gee i don t know abs sounds pretty good to me about as good as your reasoning that the kid should play a back up role rather than start every day at aaa talk about me as a gm valentine isn t saying he should back up he s saying he should be put in a position to win the job in the major leagues which imho he would if given the opportunity val if i m misinterpreting please let me know so far you have come up with two arguments against lopez he is very ordinary defensively he is young and most players suck when they are young the first is irrelevant he s trying to make the majors with his bat and the second involves seriously warped reasoning valentine ok most players are not ready for the bigs at age see current related posting on clayton one of my favorites most players benefit rather than being stagnant or hurt by playing at aaa most catchers need to be solid defensively players to help their clubs in the bigs those are the arguments against lopez for the braves for this year but the players who are ready are the best and the ones most likely to benefit from being in the majors javy lopez is not a middle of the road prospect he s the real thing now again the most important thing a player can do is hit lopez does that miles better than olson or berryhill if his defense is good enough for greenville or richmond it s good enough for atlanta if he really was awful defensively he would no longer be a catcher see sprague ed now the braves have two catchers who have demonstrated solid abilities to call games to work with the pitchers to throw out runners not superstars mind you but solid experienced veterans the braves have a very solid lineup with two big bats in the outfield an excellent platoon at first a solid mvp candidate at third and one of the better hitting shortstops the center field platoon will probably hit however good lopez what they have to offset the differential in experience and defensive ability the kid will improve playing at aaa and he probably won t being a reserve with the big club oh where to start ok first of all solid good i want good players solid is one of those words used to describe nice white guys who really aren t very good at baseball think of it as twg without the caps it s a losing strategy to say we have solid guys we don t need to improve you used it four times in that paragraph btw same for experienced i might add though that greg olson and damon berryhill aren t exactly carter and fisk olson has played three years berryhill five although and were a wash the only difference imho between olson and valle is the supporting cast two big bats hrm i like justice but i find mr gant s trend disturbing call it one and a maybe the braves platoon is ok but neither player has any value outside of the platoon bream vs lh and hunter vs rh are awful i ll leave the thirdbase comment alone pendleton has wasted too much bandwidth already if the cf platoon hits i ll retrace mr likhani s midnight run down forbes and i live in ny and la got that mike and doesn t cox call pitches anyway goodness do you believe the other poster who thinks lopez is being held down because of his future earning potential why on earth do you people thinkthe braves made this decision are they idiots who have built this ballclub

fully a month in advance no tv weatherman can match us this time we not only scored again but we were also able to disable the long island railroad making travel really difficult none the less many braved the snow and we had an interesting meeting and good conversation our scheduled speaker mrs elizabeth linnehan a professional nutritionist had a family emergency and was not able to attend she hope she will be with us in the fall to discuss diet and medications however ms jennifer friedman an image consultant and sister of a liver transplant recipient was kind enough to step in on very short notice ms friedman gave us a lot of good advice about choosing clothes and makeup even a bit for men to help us look well and healthy and to minimize some of the cosmetic effects of some of the medicine and drugs we take we are most grateful to jennifer and thank her for an entertaining evening annual meeting in addition to welcoming dr teperman the april meeting is also the annual meeting of the chapter this is the official notice of the meeting as required by our by laws the main purpose of the meeting is to review the past year solicit member views and ideas for better ways to meet

number of board members and there is plenty of work in addition brief treasurer s and membership reports will be given and the floor will be open for any new business suggestions or comments anyone

3993###sci.med###re science and methodology was homeopathy tradition in article lsu q innia saltillo cs utexas edu turpin cs utexas edu russell turpin writes i agree with everything that lee lady wrote in her previous post in this thread gee maybe i ve misjudged you russell anyone who agrees with something i say can t be all bad seriously i m not sure whether i misjudged you or not in one respect i still have a major problem though with your insistence that science is mainly about avoiding mistakes and i still disagree with your contention that nobody who doesn t use methods deemed scientific can possibly know what s true and what s not deleted material which i agree with back to lee lady these are not the rules according to many who post to sci med and sci psychology according to these posters if it s not supported by carefully designed controlled studies then it s not science these posters are making the mistake that i have previously criticized of adhering to a methodological recipe a carefully rules such as support the hypothesis by a carefully designed and controlled study are too narrow to apply to all investigation i think that the requirements for particular reasoning to be convincing depends greatly on the kinds of mistakes that have occurred in past reasoning about the same kinds of things to reuse the previous example we know that conclusions from uncontrolled observations of the treatment of chronic medical problems are notoriously problematic okay so let s see if we agree on this first of all there are degrees of certainty it might be appropriate for instance to demand carefully controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth to the extent that there is any such thing the effectiveness of a certain treatment on the other hand highly favorable clinical experience even if uncontrolled can be adequate to justify a preliminary judgement that a treatment is useful this is often the best evidence we can hope for from investigators who do not have institutional or corporate support in this case it makes sense to tentatively treat claims as credible but to reserve final judgement until establishment scientists who are qualified and have the necessary resources can do more careful testing secondly it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal i come to this dispute about what science is not only as a mathematician but as a veteran of many arguments in sci psychology and occasionally in sci med about nlp neurolinguistic programming much of the work done to date by nlpers can be better categorized as informal exploration than as careful scientific research for years now i have been trying to get scientific and clinical psychologists to just take a look at it to read a few of the books and watch some of the videotapes courtesy of your local university library not for the purpose of making a definitive judgement but simply to look at the nlp methodology especially the approach to eliciting information from subjects and look for ideas and hypotheses which might be of scientific interest and most especially to be aware of the questions nlp suggests which might be worthy of scientific investigation over and over again the response i get in sci pychology is if this hasn t been thoroughly validated by the accepted form of empirical research then it can t be of any interest to us to me the ultimate reducio ad absurdum of the extreme there ve got to be controlled studies position is an nlp technique called the fast phobia trauma cure simple phobias as opposed to agoraphobia may not be the world s most important psychological disorder but the nice thing about them is that it doesn t take a sophisticated instrument to diagnose them or tell when someone is cured of one the nlp phobia cure is a simple visualization which requires less than minutes nlpers claim that it can also be used to neutralize a traumatic memory and hence is useful in treating post traumatic stress syndrome it is essentially a variation on the classic desensitization process used by behavioral therapists a subject only needs to be taken through the technique once or in the case of ptsd once for each traumatic incident the process doesn t need to be repeated and the subject doesn t need to practice it over again at home now to me it seems pretty easy to test the effectiveness of this cure especially if as nlpers claim the success rate is extremely high take someone with a fear of heights as i used to have take them up to a balcony on the th floor and observe their response spend minutes to have them do the simple visualization send them back up to the balcony and see if things have changed check back with them in a few weeks to see if the cure seems to be lasting more long term follow up is certainly desirable but from a scientific point of view even a cure that lasts several weeks has significance in any case there are many known cases where the cure has lasted years to the best of my knowledge there is no known case where the cure has been reversed after holding for a few weeks my own cure incidentally was done with a slightly different nlp technique before i learned of the fast phobia trauma cure ten years later now i enjoy living on the th floor of my building and having a large balcony the folks over in sci psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test they claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory a study of the sort that nlp practitioners many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice can ill afford to do most of them are also just plain not interested because the whole idea seems frivolous and since they re not part of the scientific establishment they have no tangible rewards to gain from scientific acceptance the fast phobia trauma cure is over ten years old now and the clinical psychology establishment is still saying we don t have any way of knowing that it s effective these academics themselves have the resources to do a study as elaborate as anyone could want of course but they say why should i prove your theory and the burden of proof is on the one making the claim one academic in sci psychology said that it would be completely unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn t been described in a scientific journal it s described in a number of books and i ve posted articles in sci psychology describing it in as much detail as i m capable of actually at least one fairly careful academic study has been done with favorable results but it s apparently not acceptable because it s a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal to me this sort of attitude does not advance science but hinders it this is the kind of thing i have in mind when i talk about doctrinnaire attitudes about science now maybe i have been unfair in imputing such attitudes to you russell if so i apologize in the arguments between behaviorists and cognitivists psychology seems less like a science than a collection of competing

3996###sci.med###re barbecued foods and health risk this reminds me of the last graham kerr cooking show i saw today he smoked meat on the stovetop in a big pot he used a strange technique i d never seen before he took a big pot with lid and placed a tray in it made from aluminum foil the tray was about the size and shape of a typical coffee table ash tray made by crumpling a sheet of foil around the edges in the tray he placed a couple spoonfuls of brown sugar a similar quantity of brown rice he said any rice will do the contents of two teabags of earl grey tea and a few cloves on top of this was placed an ordinary aluminum basket type steamer with two chicken breasts in it the lid was put on and the whole assembly went on the stovetop at high heat for or minutes later he removed what looked like smoked chicken breasts what surprises and concerns me are no wood chips where does the smoke flavor come from about or years ago i remember hearing that carmel color obtained by caramelizing sugar a common coloring and flavoring agent had been found to be carcinogenic i believe they injected it under the skin of rats or something if the results were conclusive caramel color would not be legal in the u s yet it is still being used was the initial research result found to be incorrect or what about or years ago i remember earl grey tea being implicated as carcinogenic because it contains oil of bergamot an extract from the skin of a type of citrus fruit does anyone know whatever happened with that story if it were carcinogenic earl grey tea could not have it as an additive yet it apparently continues to do so wrt natural wood smoke i ve smoking a duck right now as it happens i ve noticed that a heavily smoked food item will have an unpleasant tangy taste when eaten directly out of the smoker if the smoke has only recently stopped flowing i find the best taste to be had by using dry wood chips getting lots of smoke right up at the beginning of the cooking process then slowly barbequing for hours and hours without adding additional wood chips my theory is that the unpleasant tangy molecules are low molecular weight stuff like terpenes and that the smoky flavor molecules are some sort of larger molecule more similar to tar the long barbeque time after the initial intensive smoke drives off the low molecular weight stuff just leaving the flavor behind does anyone know if my theory is correct i also remember hearing that the combustion products of fat dripping on the charcoal and burning are carcinogenic for that reason and because it covers the product with soot and some unpleasant tanginess i only grill non drippy meats like prawns directly over hot coals i do stuff like this duck by indirect heat i have a long rectangular weber and i put the coals at one end and the meat at the other end the fat drops directly on the floor below the meat and next time i use the barbeque i make the fire in that end to burn off the fat and help ignite the coals and yet another reason i ve heard not to smoke or barbeque meat is that smoked cured meat like pork sausage and bacon contains nitrosamines which are carcinogenic i m pretty sure this claim actually has some standing don t know about the others an amusing incident i recall was the duncan hines scandal when it was discovered that the people who make duncan hines cake mix were putting a lot of ethylene dibromide edb into the cake mix to suppress weevils this is a fumigant which is known to be carcinogenic the guy who represented the company in the press conference defended himself by saying that the risk from eating duncan hines products every day for a year would be equal to the cancer risk from eating two charcoal broiled steaks what a great analogy when i first heard that my immediate reaction was we should make that a standard unit one charcoal broiled steak would be equivalent to duncans

4036###sci.med###critique of pressure point massager as promised below is a personal critique of a pressure point massager i recently bought from the self care catalog i am very pleased with the results the catalog description is as follows the pressure point massager is an aggressive physical massager that actually kneads the tension out of muscles much like a professional shiatsu masseur the powerful motor drives two counter rotating thumbs that move in one inch orbits releasing tension in the neck back legs and arms pressure point massager a to order or receive a catalog call hours days or fax at note when i ordered the massager the item number was different and the price was not when i received it i glanced thru the newer catalog enclosed with it to see anything was different from the first one i was quite annoyed to see a difference in price i called them about it and the cust rep said that they had switched manufacturers although it looks and works exactly the same he told me to go ahead and return the first one and order the cheaper one using the price difference as a reason for return in fact since the newer ones might take a while to ship from the factory i received this one in days he told me i could use the one i already have until the new one arrives then return the old one very reasonable people i have long term neck shoulder and back pain if i were a building i would be described as structurally unsound i have stretches and exercises to do that help but the problem never really goes away if for whatever reason i do not exercise for a while illness not enough time lazy etc the muscles become quite stiff and painful and thus more prone to further strain even with exercise i sometimes require physical therapy to get back on track which st requires a doctor visit to get the prescription for p t the tension in my neck if not released eventually causes a headache sometimes confused with a sinus headache over my left eye when my physical therapist has massaged my neck and the sub occipital muscles in particular the knobby areas near the base of the skull the headache usually eased within a day although it hurts like hell to while it is being massaged i ordered this device because it seemed to be exactly what i was wishing someone would invent a machine that would massage not vibrate my neck and sub occipital muscles like my physical therapist has done in the past that i could use by myself no doctor visit or inconvenient p t appts for a week later would be needed to use it i could get up in the middle of the night and use it if necessary i have been using it for about a week or so now and love it the base unit is about a x rectangle about high with handles on each side and it plugs into an average outlet the two metal thumbs are about in diameter and protrude about above the base the thumbs are covered with a gray cloth that is non removable they are located more toward one end rather than centered see figure below they move in either clockwise or counter clockwise directions depending on which side of the switch is pushed and are very quiet it can be used from either side for instance the thumbs can be positioned at the base of the neck or the top of the neck depending on which direction you approach it for the neck head the user varies the amount of pressure used by if laying down allowing all or part of the full weight of the head and or neck to rest on the thumbs the handles can also be used if sitting or standing applying pressure with the arms wrists since my wrists are also impaired i m typing this over an extended period of time and i don t have someone living with me who can apply it laying down works well for me for my back i sit in a high backed kitchen chair position the massager behind me at whatever point i want massaged and lean back lightly or not so lightly against it the pressure of leaning back holds it in place if i want to massage the entire spine i simply move it down a few inches whenever i feel like it for my back this machine is far superior to use than the commonly used home made massager of tennis balls taped together with the balls position against a wall or door them over the spine and move the body up and down against them the tennis balls are better than nothing but difficult to use for very long especially if your quads are not in good shape and my long hair gets painfully in the way if i don t pin it up first as far as i m concerned the easier something like this is to use the more likely i ll use do it if there are multiple considerations hassles i m more likely to not bother with it not only has this machine helped with my headaches but my range of motion for my neck and back are greatly increased the first time i used it on my neck sub occipital muscles however i overdid it and pressed too hard against it which resulted in a very tender almost bruised area for a few days i laid off it for about days and applied ice which helped after that i was more gradual about applying pressure at this point the pain in the sub occipital area is now minimal while being massaged i also learned to use very light pressure on my lower back which is the most vulnerable point for me it also eased some painful knots of tension between my shoulder blades although again it took a few days of massaging just a few minutes at a time to really work it out i highly recommend this product if you have similar problems although i cannot vouch for its durability it seems pretty sturdy since i ve had it such a short time i plan to use it not only to ease tension but also to loosen the muscls before exercising and maybe after too i have been ill recently and not able to exercise much for a few weeks so this was very timely for me this is the st product i ve ordered from this company and only recently became aware of it thru a co worker the catalog states they have been in business since it contains quite a few health care products and while they appear to be more expensive than the average health care catalog products they also appear to be of much higher quality with more thought put into what they actually do definitely a step above some other ones i ve seen such as dr leonards health care catalog or mature wisdom i m only but have ended up on some geriatric type mailing lists no big surprise here i

4064###sci.med###re science and methodology was homeopathy tradition i think that part of the problem is that i have proposed a definition of science that i intended to be interpreted broadly and that lee lady has interpreted fairly narrowly my definition is this science is the investigation of the empirical that avoids mistakes in reasoning and methodology discovered from previous work lee lady writes i don t think that science should be defined in a way that some of the activities that lead to really important science namely thinking and informal exploration are not recognized as scientific work unless one classifies thinking and informal exploration as a mistake they fall under my definition i hope no one would consider speculation thinking and informal exploration as unscientific in article c nasf mh news hawaii edu lady uhunix uhcc hawaii edu lee lady writes seriously i m not sure whether i misjudged you or not in one respect i still have a major problem though with your insistence that science is mainly about avoiding mistakes here is where i think we are talking at cross purposes it is not clear to me that the kind of definition i have proposed should be taken as describing what science is mainly about consider for example a definition of invertebrates as all animals lacking a backbone this fairly tells what is an invertebrate and what is not an invertebrate but it hardly tells you what invertebrates are all about one can read this definition and still not know that of all animal species are invertebrates that invertebrates possess a remarkably broad range of form that some invertebrate groups such as insects and nematodes are ubiquitous in all ecosystems etc in short knowing the definition of invertebrates does not tell one what they are mainly about the misunderstanding here is my fault i did not give sufficient context for people to understand my proposed definition okay so let s see if we agree on this first of all there are degrees of certainty it might be appropriate for instance to demand carefully controlled trials before we accept as absolute scientific truth to the extent that there is any such thing the effectiveness of a certain treatment on the other hand highly favorable clinical experience even if uncontrolled can be adequate to justify a preliminary judgement that a treatment is useful secondly it makes sense to be more tolerant in our standards of evidence for a pronounced effect than for one that is marginal i agree on both counts as an example of the second it would only take a few cases of curing rabies to convince most veterinarians that a treatment was effective despite a lack of controls as to the first i do not think it is useful to talk about absolute scientific truth i think it is more useful to talk about the kinds of evidence that various claims have and the kinds of evidence in particular fields that in the past have proven faulty or reliable the latter is obviously a matter of degree and in each field practitioners try to discover the relevance of different kinds of evidence one of the primary mistakes that marks the advocacy of an idea as psuedo science is that the advocacy lacks any sense of proportion regarding the kinds of evidence related to the proposed claim the kinds of evidence that are actually relevant to it and the historical reasons in the field that certain kinds of evidence are given more weight than others it is perfectly alright to speculate i have read quite a few refereed papers that speculated left and right but the authors were careful to identify the notions as speculative to list what little evidence was presently available for them and to describe how research could proceed to either put the notion on more firm footing or to uncover its problems often what distinguishes whether a paper of this sort passes muster is the thoughtfulness with which the author sets the context and paves the way for future work it is in this area that many proponents of speculative ideas fail the folks over in sci psychology have a hundred and one excuses not to make this simple test they claim that only an elaborate outcome study will be satisfactory a study of the sort that nlp practitioners many of whom make a barely marginal living from their practice can ill afford to do most of them are also just plain not interested because the whole idea seems frivolous and since they re not part of the scientific establishment they have no tangible rewards to gain from scientific acceptance i think a lot of scientists steer away from things that deserving or not garner a patina of kookiness when proponents of some practice see no value in more careful investigation of that practice that sets alarms ringing in many researchers minds this is unfortunate because there is undoubtedly some intersection between things that are worth investigating and things that are advocated by those who seem careless or unreasonable in their advocacy on the other hand i can understand why many scientists would just as soon select other directions for research as gordon banks has pointed out no one wants to become this generation s rhine one academic in sci psychology said that it would be completely unscientific for him to test the phobia cure since it hasn t been described in a scientific journal i think this is absurd actually at least one fairly careful academic study has been done with favorable results but it s apparently not acceptable because it s a doctoral dissertation and not published in a refereed journal i wonder why the results were not published in my field dissertation results are typically summarized in papers that are submitted to journals often the papers are accepted for publication before the dissertation is finished this certainly eases one s defense finally i hope lee lady will forgive me from commenting either on nlp or the discussion of it in sci psychology i know little about either and so have nothing to offer russell

thread that s because these peer reviewed studies are not addressing the effects of msg in people they re looking at animal models you can t walk away from this and start ranting about gloom and doom as if there were any documented deleterious health effects demonstrated in humans note that i wouldn t have any argument with a statement like noting that animal administration has pro duced the following blah blah we must be careful about its use in humans this is precisely not what you said among others see olney s excitotoxic food aditives relevance of animal studies to human safety neurobehav toxicol teratol vol i m sure peta would love to hear your arguments tests have been done on rhesus monkeys as well i have never seen a study where the mode of administration was intra ventricular the glu and asp were administered orally some studies used iv and sc intra ventricular is not a normal admin method for food tox studies for obvious reasons you must not have read the peer reviewed works that i referred to or you would never have come up with this brain injection bunk it most certainly is for neurotoxicology you know studies of glutamate involve more than food science whose talking about food science what is this comment supposed to mean neurotoxicology and tratology brain research nature progress in brain research all fine food science journals pardon me but where are you getting this from have you read the journals have you done a thorough literature search so point us to the studies in humans please i m familiar with the literature and i ve never seen any which relate at all to olney s work in animals and the effects of glutamate on neurons then you would know that olney himself has casually referred to chinese restaurant syndrome in a few articles why don t you point us to some studies maybe then this exchange could be productive the point is exceeding the window of course they re amino acids note that people with pku cannot tolerate any phenylalanine well actually they have to tolerate some phenylalanine it s a essential amino acid they just try to get as little as is healthy without producing dangerous levels of phenylalanine and its metabolites in the blood they re unable to metabolise it olney s research compared infant human diets specifically the amount of freely available glu in mother s milk versus commercial baby foods vs typical lunch items from the standard american diet such as packaged soup mixes he found that one could exceed the projected safety margin for infant humans by at least four fold in a single meal of processed foods mother s milk was well below the effective dose goodness i m not saying that it s good to feed infants a lot of glutamate supplemented foods it s just that this projected safety margin is a construct derived from animal models and given that you can prove anything you like we re talking prudent policy in infant nutrition here yet you re misrepresenting it as received wisdom who said anything about received wisdom there is no question that orally administered doses of msg are capable of destroying nearly all neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus and the median eminence these areas are responsible for the production of hormones critical to normal neuroendocrine function and the normal development of the vertabrate organism humans are vertebrates now what pray tell do you think will happen when the area of the brain necessary for the normal rhythm of gonadotropin release is missing are you trying to say that humans have no need of their pituitary anh and me of that part of the brain that is responsible for controlling the realease albeit indirectly of estradiol and testosterone how do you expect anyone to do the studies on this it s unethical to sacrifice humans to check out what effects chronic acute etc doses of these compounds are having on the brain tissue in humans the food industry knows this that s why the animal model is used in medicine and psych if you re talking about straight sensitivity it would be useful to define the term there are plenty of studies on psychoneuroimmunology showing the link between attitude and physiology i suspect we may be arguing about separate things only adult sensitivities you and late occuring sequelae of childhood ingestion and its implication for adults me certainly the doses for excitotoxicity in adults are considerably larger than for the young but the additivity of glu and asp and their copious and increased presence in modern processed foods jointly and their hidden presence in hvp necessitates extreme caution why would anyone want to eat compounds which have been shown to markedly perturb the endocrine system in adults the main point is blood levels attained and oral doses would likely have to be greater than sc between who over what i would be most interested in seeing you provide peer reviewed non food industry funded citations to articles disputing that msg has no effects whatsoever you mean asserting you re being intellectually dishonest or just plain confused because you re conflating reports which do not necessarily have anything to do with each other olney s reports would argue a potential for problems in human infants but that s not to say that this says anything whatsoever about the use of msg in most foods nor does he provide any studies in humans which indicate any deleterious effects for obvious reasons it says nothing about msg s contribtion to the phenomenon of the chinese restaurant syndrome it says nothing about the frequent inability to replicate anecdotal reports of msg sensitivity in the lab olney s work provides a putative causal mechanism for some sensitivities terry epelbaum and martin have shown that orally administered msg causes changes in normal gonadotropic hormone fluctutations in adults glu also was found to induce immediate and persistant supression of rhythmic gh secretion and to induce rapid and transient release of prolactin in adults chronically exposed to msg gh is responsible not only for control of growth during development but also converts glycogen into glucose could this be the cause

4148###sci.med###relief of pain caused by cancer i am not sure if this is the proper group to post this to but here goes anyway about five years ago my mother was diagnosed with having cancer in the lymph nodes under one of her arms after the doctors removed the cancerous area she had full movement of her arm with only slight aching under her arm when she moved it over the course of the next two years the aching got more severe and her complaining to the doctors produced the explanation that it was scar tissue causing the pain at this time her doctor suggested that some physiotherapy should be employed to break up the scar tissue while attending one of her therapy sessions while her arm was being manipulated some damage occured nerve which caused the level of pain to permanently increase severly controlled by tylenol s and some loss of use of the arm palsied wrist and almost no outward lateral movement with great persistence on her part the doctors looked further into the issue and discovered that not all of the cancer had been removed and another tumor had grown under the arm this was removed also but the pain in the arm has not decreased the doctors are not sure exactly why the pain is persisting but feel some sort of nerve damage has occured and they have employed tylenol and soon morphine to relieve the pain she has tried acupuncture by this only provides minor reductions in pain and is only short term my questions are has anyone has heard of similar cases and what if anything was done to reduce the levels of pain are their methods to block nerves so that the pain can be reduced are their methods to restore nerves so that loss of arm function can be restored any general suggestions on pain reduction would be greatly appreciated please respond by email because i do not always get chance to read this group if anyone knows of some literature that may be useful to this case or another newsgroup that i should be posting this to it would also be appreciated gregory w luft internet vgwlu calgary chevron com chevron petroleum techonology company tel fifth ave s w fax calgary alberta canada t p l

evidence that such a disease exists there s a lot of evidence it just hasn t been adequately gathered and published in a way that will convince the die hard melancholic skeptics who quiver everytime the word anecdote or empirical is used snort ah there go my sinuses again for example dr ivker who wrote the book sinus survival always gives oh wow a classic textbook hey they laughed at einstein too before any other treatment a systemic anti fungal such as nizoral to his new patients if they ve been on braod spectrum anti biotics or more times in the last two years he s kept a record of the results and for over patients found that over of his patients get significant relief of allergic sinus symptoms of course this is only the beginning for his program yeah i ll bet tomorrow the world listen uncontrolled studies like this are worthless in my case as i reported a few weeks ago i was developing the classic symptoms outlined in the yeast connection i agree it is a poorly written book e g extreme sensitivity to plastics vapors etc which i never had before started in november within one week of full dosage of sporanox the sensitivity to chemicals has fully disappeared i can now sit on my couch at home without dying after two minutes i m also greatly improved in other areas as well i m sure you are you sound like the typical hysteric hypochondriac who responds to miracle cures of course i have allergy symptoms etc i am especially allergic to molds yeasts etc it doesn t take a rocket scientist to figure out that if one has excessive colonization of yeast in the body and you have a natural allergy to yeasts that a threshold would be reached where you would have perceptible symptoms yeah it makes sense to me so of course it should be taken seriously snort also yeast do produce toxins of various sorts and again you don t have to be a rocket scientist to realize that such toxins can cause problems in some people yeah it sounds reasonable to me of course the question is whether a person who is immune compromised as tests showed i was from over years of antibiotics nutritionally deficiencies because of the stress of infections and allergies etc oh really what tests immune compromised my ass more like credulous malingerer this is a psychiatric syndrome can develop excessive yeast colonization somewhere in the body it is a tough question to answer since testing for excessive yeast colonization is not easy one almost has to take an empirical approach to diagnosis fortunately sporanox is relatively safe unlike past anti fungals still have to be careful however so there s no reason any longer to withhold sporanox treatment for empirical reasons you know it s a shame that a drug like itraconazole is being misused in this way it s ridiculously expensive and potentially toxic the trouble is that it isn t toxic enough so it gets abused by quacks btw some would say to try nystatin unfortunately most yeast grows hyphae too deep into tissue for nystatin to have any permanent affect you ll find a lot of people who are on nystatin all the time the only good thing about nystatin is that it s relatively cheap and when taken orally non toxic but oral nystatin is without any systemic effect so unless it were given iv it would be without any effect on your sinuses i wish these quacks would first use iv nystatin or amphotericin b on people like you that would solve the yeast problem once and for all in summary i appreciate all of the attempts by those who desire to keep medicine on the right road but methinks that some who hold too firmly to the party line are academics who haven t been in the trenches long enough actually treating patients if anybody doctors included said to me to my face that there is no evidence of the yeast connection i cannot guarantee their safety for their incompetence ripping off their lips is justified as far as i am concerned perhaps a little haldol would go a long way towards ameliorating your symptoms are you paying for this treatment out of your own pocket i d hate to think my insurance premiums are going towards this steve dyer dyer you re rude medicine is not a totallly scientific endevour it s often practiced in a disorganized manner most early treatment of non life threatening illness is done on a guess hazarded after anecdotal evidence given by the patient it s an educated guess by a trained person but it s still no more than a guess it s cheaper and simpler to medicate first and only deal further with those people who don t respond there are diseases that haven t been described yet and the root cause of many diseases now described aren t known read a book on gastroenterology sometime if you want to see a lot of them after scientific methods have run out then it s the patient s freedom of choice to try any experimental method they choose and it s well recognized by many doctors that medicine doesn t have all the answers this person said that they had relief by taking the medicine maybe it s a miracle cure maybe it s valid how do you know you might argue with the reasoning the conclusions but your disparaging attack is unwarranted why don t you present an convincing argument for you r beliefs instead of wasting our time in an ad hominem attack jackie

systems br div of sexually transmitted diseases and hiv prevention national center for prevention svcs cdc editorial note the increase in reported gonorrhea cases in colorado in may represent an overall increase in the occurrence of this disease or more complete reporting stimulated by visitations to laboratories by cdh surveillance staff during the increases in confirmed gonorrhea cases at dmhc and in culture positivity rates in three of four laboratories suggest a real increase in gonorrhea rather than a reporting artifact however the stable culture positivity rate in the nonprofit family planning laboratory which serves a network of clinics statewide indicates that the gonorrhea increase did not uniformly affect all segments of the population one possible explanation for the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in colorado may be gang and drug related sexual behavior as implicated in a recent outbreak of drug resistant gonorrhea and other stds in colorado springs although the high morbidity census tracts in the denver metropolitan area coincide with areas of gang and drug activity this hypothesis requires further assessment to examine the possible role of drug use implicated previously as a factor contributing to the national increase in syphilis the cdh std aids program is collecting information from all persons in whom gonorrhea is diagnosed regarding drug use exchange of sex for money or drugs and gang affiliation the gonorrhea rate for blacks in colorado substantially exceeds the national health objective for the year per objective a race is likely a risk marker rather than a risk factor for gonorrhea and other stds risk markers may be useful for identifying groups at greatest risk for stds and for targeting prevention efforts moreover race specific variation in std rates may reflect differences in factors such as socioeconomic status access to medical care and high risk behaviors in response to the increased occurrence of gonorrhea in

page volume number april laws included all children aged less than years but the other two states used both age and size of the child as criteria for mandatory restraint use the analysis in this report subgrouped states into those having a law requiring adult safety belt use law states and those without such a law no law states overall of children aged less than years reportedly were not consistently restrained during automobile travel both child restraint use and adult restraint use were significantly higher p less than chi square test in law states than in no law states versus and versus respectively high rates of restraint use for children aged less than or equal to year were reported by both adults indicating consistent and less than consistent safety belt use figure adults with consistent use reported high rates of child occupant restraint use regardless of the child s age range for year olds to for year olds in comparison for adults reporting less than consistent safety belt use the rate of child occupant restraint use declined sharply by the age of the child range for year olds to for year olds when comparing children of consistent adult safety belt users with children of less than consistent adult safety belt users confidence intervals overlap for the two youngest age groups i e aged less than and year reported child occupant restraint use in law states generally exceeded that in no law states regardless of age of child table in addition higher adult educational attainment was significantly associated with increased restraint use for children a factor that has also been associated with increased adult safety belt use reported by national center for injury prevention and control national center for chronic disease prevention and health promotion cdc editorial note the findings in this report are consistent with others indicating that adults who do not use safety belts themselves are less likely to employ occupant restraints for their children because these nonbelted adults are at increased risk of crashing and more likely to exhibit other risk taking behaviors children traveling with them may be at greater risk for motor vehicle injury educational attainment of adult respondents was inversely associated with child restraint use in this report accordingly occupant protection programs should be promoted among parents with low educational attainment because low educational attainment is often associated with low socioeconomic status such programs should be offered to adults through health care facilities that serve low income communities or through federal programs i e head start that are directed at parents with young children injury prevention programs emphasize restraining young children in addition however efforts must be intensified to protect child occupants as hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april they become older parents especially those with low educational attainment those who do not consistently wear safety belts and those from states that do not have mandatory safety belt use laws should be encouraged to wear safety belts and to protect their children by using approved child safety seats and safety belts finally the increased use of restraints among children may increase their likelihood of using safety belts when they become teenagers the age group characterized by the

birth defects surveillance in metropolitan atlanta georgia and selected jurisdictions in california for the years description of system the california birth defects monitoring program and the metropolitan atlanta congenital defects program are two population based surveillance systems that employ similar data collection methods the prevalence estimates for diagnostic categories were based on data for for births in california and births in metropolitan atlanta the prevalences in the two areas were compared adjusting for race sex and maternal age by using poisson regression results regional differences in the prevalence of aortic stenosis fetal alcohol syndrome hip dislocation dysplasia microcephalus obstruction of the kidney ureter and scoliosis lordosis may be attributable to general diagnostic variability however differences in the prevalences of arm hand limb reduction encephalocele spina bifida or trisomy down syndrome are probably not attributable to differences in ascertainment because these defects are relatively easy to diagnose interpretation regional differences in prenatal diagnosis and pregnancy termination may affect prevalences of trisomy and spina bifida however the reason for differences in arm hand reduction is unknown but may be related to variability in environmental exposure heterogeneity in the gene pool or random variation actions taken because of the similarities of these data bases several collaborative studies are being implemented in particular the differences in the birth prevalence of spina bifida and down syndrome will focus

period covered this report covers u s influenza surveillance conducted from october through may description of system weekly reports from the vital statistics offices of cities provided an index of influenza s impact on mortality who collaborating laboratories reported weekly identification of influenza viruses weekly morbidity reports were received both from the state and territorial epidemiologists and from sentinel family practice physicians nonsystematic reports of outbreaks and unusual illnesses were received throughout the year results during the influenza season influenza a h n and b viruses were identified in the united states with essentially equal frequency overall although both regional and temporal patterns of predominance shifted over the course of the season throughout the season increases in the indices of influenza morbidity in regions where influenza a h n predominated were similar to increases in regions where influenza b predominated only of identified viruses were influenza a h n but isolations of this subtype increased as the season waned and it subsequently predominated during the season during the season outbreaks in nursing homes were reported in association with influenza b and a h n but not influenza a h n interpretation the alternating temporal and geographic predominance of influenza strains a h n and b during the season emphasizes the importance of continual attention to regional viral strain surveillance since amantadine is effective only for treatment and prophylaxis of influenza a actions taken weekly interim analyses of surveillance data produced throughout the season allow physicians and public health officials to make informed choices regarding appropriate use of amantadine cdc s annual surveillance

of arizona high tech assisted reproductive technologies following the birth of the first in vitro fertilization embryo transfer ivf et baby in a host of assisted reproductive technologies have been developed that include ivf et gamete intrafallopian tube transfer gift embryo cryopreservation freezing and gamete micromanipulation together these technologies are referred to as the high tech assisted reproductive technology art procedures ovulation induction sperm insemination and surgery for tubal disease and or pathology still are the mainstays of the therapies available for infertility management however when these fail it almost always is appropriate to proceed with one of the art procedures therefore in addition to a comprehensive basic and general infertility service at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology and infertility there is a program of assisted reproduction that specializes in art procedures this program serves as a tertiary provider for those patients in the state of arizona whose infertility problems cannot be resolved by the traditional therapies the following article on back describes the art procedures available in our center clarifies appropriate applications for each and considers the realistic expectations for their success procedures included are o in vitro o fertilization embryo transfer ivf et gamete intrafallopian tube transfer o gift cryopreservation of human embryos and gamete micromanipulation this article also considers ongoing research in our program that is directed towards improved success of these technologies hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april future areas of research in addition to ongoing research that is directed exclusively toward the management of infertile couples we are developing the technology to assist couples who are at risk for producing embryos with a serious hereditary disease this technology involves biopsying the preimplantation human embryo and then subjecting the biopsied cells to genetic analysis using either dna amplification or fluorescent in situ hybridization there are recent reports of the successful application of dna amplification by other centers for example for diagnosis of the genes for cystic fibrosis and hemophilia we hope to apply and further focus fluorescent in situ hybridization technology for probing the x chromosome the identification of which will provide a scientific basis for counselling patients who exhibit sex linked disorders the considerable clinical application of such technology lies in the fact that it circumvents the need for prenatal diagnosis in addition to the possibility of a subsequent termination of affected fetuses in order to avoid the birth of affected children catherine racowsky ph d associate professor and director of research department of obstetrics and gynecology college of medicine university of arizona tucson arizona applications success rates and advances for the management of infertility the following are the art procedures available at the university of arizona center for reproductive endocrinology and infertility in vitro fertilization embryo transfer is the core art procedure of our assisted reproduction program this procedure involves retrieval of unfertilized eggs from the ovary their insemination in vitro in a dish and the culture of resultant embryos for or days before they are transferred to the patient s uterus all cultures are maintained in an incubator under strictly controlled atmospheric and temperature conditions before being processed for use in insemination semen samples are evaluated in our andrology laboratory using both subjective light microscopy and computer hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april assisted semen analyses to ensure an adequate number of eggs with which to perform ivf et or indeed gift follicular development is typically stimulated with gonadotropins perganol metrodin gonadotropin releasing hormone gnrh factrel lutrepulse and or gnrh analogues lupron depo lupron synarel occasionally however ivf et is accomplished with eggs obtained in non stimulated cycles while some programs utilize laparoscopic egg retrieval in the operating room with the patient under general anesthesia we undertake the less costly approach of ultrasound guided retrieval in our infertility unit with the patient sedated couples who resort to ivf et exhibit such pathologies as tubal deficiencies ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis and or mild forms of male factor infertility according to the united states ivf registry the overall success rate for ivf et nationwide has stabilized at about percent per cycle results from our program involving patients who have undergone ivf et cycles reflect a comparable success rate nevertheless the overall incidence of success with this procedure is disconcertingly low and emphasizes the need to address those physiological factors that limit achievement of a higher percentage of pregnancies well recognized predictors of outcome include patient age response to exogenous ovarian stimulation quality of sperm and number of repeated ivf et cycle attempts however among these age is the single most significant determinant of conception therefore it is critical that such patients are referred to an assisted reproduction program at the earliest opportunity following failure of traditional therapies the underlying basis for the negative effect of age on fertility has not been clearly delineated beyond recognition that the number of eggs available for retrieval declines markedly with age fertilization rates significantly decrease in eggs retrieved from patients who are over years and provided the appropriate hormonal background is present age is unrelated to uterine competency to sustain pregnancy ongoing research in our center therefore is investigating physiological changes in the egg that may be impacted by age we have determined that more than percent of eggs that fail to fertilize in vitro are chromosomally abnormal and that a significant proportion of these abnormalities are accountable to patient age currently the only recourse for such patients is to use eggs obtained from a donor our program has initiated recruitment of volunteer egg donors to satisfy the needs of a list of recipients interested in this form of therapy gift this high tech art procedure is performed in the operating room usually with the use of a laparoscope and in contrast to ivf et involves introducing sperm and freshly retrieved eggs into the lumen of the fallopian tube an average of eggs tube under these circumstances fertilization occurs in vivo and if excess eggs are retrieved the remainder undergo ivf with subsequent options for embryo transfer in that cycle or freezing for transfer in a subsequent cycle this art procedure is applied to cases in hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april which there is at least one patent fallopian tube but the couple has such pathologies as ovulatory dysfunction endometriosis male factor infertility and or idiopathic infertility the data reported in the united states ivf registry for through indicate that the overall success rate with gift is higher than that obtained with the ivf et technique range of clinical pregnancies for gift is to percent and for ivf et to percent in view of this fact one might expect more patients to be treated with gift than ivf et however in our program we have taken into account three basic concerns which while substantially reducing the number of gift cycles performed benefit the patient these concerns are the increased costs associated with performing a procedure in the operating room the risks albeit minimal of undergoing general anesthesia and the considerable benefits to be accrued from obtaining direct information on the quality and fertilizability of the eggs and the developmental competency of resultant embryos the increased success with gift undoubtedly reflects the artificial environment provided by the laboratory in the ivf et procedure between january and december we have performed a total of gift cycles with an overall success rate of percent embryo cryopreservation or freezing is applied in our program when embryos result from residual gift eggs or from non transferred ivf embryos this procedure not only provides patients with a subsequent opportunity for success at much reduced costs but also circumvents the legal and ethical issues relating to disposal of supernumerary embryos therefore as stipulated by the american fertility society ethical guidelines for art programs from both a practical and an ethical standpoint all assisted reproduction programs should have the capability of cryopreserving human embrys gamete micromanipulation this art procedure which is still very new is applied to couples who are unaccepting of insemination with donor semen but who have severe male factor infertility less than million sperm ml in combination with fewer than perccent motile sperm and or less than percent sperm with normal morphology we are currently developing the procedure of sub zonal insertion szi which entails injecting sperm under the coating around the egg the barrier normally penetrated by the sperm through enzymatic digestion available data from szi programs world wide indicate that only to percent of szi cycles result in a pregnancy this statistic undoubtedly relates to limitations imposed by abnormalities inherent in the sperm therefore we are currently focusing on the development of improved techniques for the recognition and selection of sperm chosen for manipulation such efforts are unquestionably worthwhile in view of the fact that this technology offers the only realistic opportunity for severe male factor patients to establish conception catherine racowsky ph d hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april associate professor and director of research department

possible after seroconversion resulting from recent findings that show hiv is active in the body in large numbers much earlier than was previously believed anthony fauci director of the u s national institute of allergy and infectious diseases niaid said we must address the question of how to treat people as early as we possibly can with drugs that are safe enough to give people for years and that will get around microbial resistance he said any delay would signify questions over safety and resistance rather than a lack of funds fauci who co authored one of the two papers published last week in nature rejects the argument by one of his co authors cecil fox that the new discovery indicates that billion spent on vaccine trials has been a waste of time and money because the trials were started too long after the patients were infected and were ended too quickly john tew of the medical college of virginia in richmond claims that the new evidence strongly backs the argument for early treatment of hiv infected patients aids activists welcomed the new information but said the scientific community has been slow to understand the significance of infection of the lymph tissue we ve known about this for five years but we re glad it is now in the public domain said jesse dobson of the california based project inform but peter duesberg who believes that aids is independent of hiv and is a result of drug abuse in the west said we are several paradoxes away from an explanation of aids even if these papers are right april risk of aids virus from doctors found to be minimal washington post p a the risk of hiv being transmitted from infected health care professionals to patients is minimal according to new research published in today s journal of the american medical association jama this finding supports previous conclusions by health experts that the chance of contracting hiv from a health care worker is remote three studies in the jama demonstrate that thousands of patients were treated by two hiv positive surgeons and dentists without becoming infected with the virus the studies were conducted by separate research teams in new hampshire maryland and florida each study started with an hiv positive doctor or dentist and tested all patients willing to participate the new hampshire study found that none of the patients who had undergone invasive procedures by an hiv positive orthopedic surgeon contracted hiv in maryland of patients operated on by a breast surgery specialist at johns hopkins hospital were found to be hiv negative similarly in florida of dental hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april patients who all had been treated by an hiv positive general dentist were tested and found to be negative for hiv the florida

smaller about to total will be available this year for or grants kaiya montaocean of the center for natural and traditional medicine in washington d c says the oam is afraid to become involved in aids they have to look successful and there is no easy answer in aids she said there is also a common perception that the oam will focus on fields the nih establishment will find non threatening such as relaxation techniques and acupuncture when the oam called for an advisory committee conference of about people last year the aids community was largely missing from the meeting in addition activists general lack of contact with the office has added suspicion that the epidemic will be ignored jon greenberg of act up new york said the oam advisory panel is composed of practitioners without real research experience it will take them several years to accept the nature of research nevertheless dr leanna standish research director and aids investigator at the bastyr college of naturopathic

care agency santa ana calif and the emory university school of public health in atlanta ga respectively dr berkley s editorial on why american doctors should care about the aids epidemic beyond the united states details several reasons for the concerted interest that all countries share in combating aids it should be noted that while aids leads in hastening global health interdependence it is not the only illness doing so diseases such as malaria and many respiratory and intestinal pathogens have similarly inhibited the economic development of most of humanity and acted to marginalize large populations berkley mentions the enormous social and economic impact that aids will have on many developing countries and the increased need for international assistance that will result berkley also cites the lack of political aggressiveness toward the aids epidemic in its first decade but now there is a new administration with a promise of substantial differences in approach to international health and development in general and hiv aids in particular vice president al gore proposes in his book earth in the balance a major environmental initiative that includes sustainable international development with programs to promote literacy improve child survival and disseminate contraceptive technology and access throughout the developing world if enacted this change in policy could drastically change the future of worldwide health aids and priorities in the global village in reply journal of the american hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april medical association vol no p berkley seth every nation should tackle hiv as early and aggressively as possible before the disease reaches an endemic state even at a cost of diverting less attention to some other illnesses writes seth berkley of the rockefeller foundation in new york n y in reply to a letter by drs gellert and nordenberg although it is true that diseases other than aids such as malaria and respiratory and intestinal illnesses have similarly inhibited economic development in developing countries and deserve much more attention than they are getting berkley disagrees with the contention that aids is receiving too much attention hiv differs from other diseases in most developing countries because it is continuing to spread for most endemic diseases the outcome of neglecting interventions for one year is another year of about the same level of needless disease and death but with aids and its increasing spread the cost of neglect not only in disease burden but financially is much greater interventions in the early part of a rampantly spreading epidemic like hiv are highly cost effective because each individual infection prevented significantly interrupts transmission berkley says he agrees with gellert and nordenberg about the gigantic social and economic effects of aids and about the need for political leadership but he concludes that not only is assertive political leadership needed in the united states for the aids epidemic but even more so in developing countries with high rates of hiv infection and where complacency about the epidemic has been the rule hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april aids hiv articles first hiv vaccine trial begins in hiv infected children h h s n e w s u s department of health and human services march first hiv vaccine therapy trial begins in hiv infected children the national institutes of health has opened the first trial of experimental hiv vaccines in children who are infected with the human immunodeficiency virus hiv the virus that causes aids the trial will compare the safety of three hiv experimental vaccines in children recruited from at least sites nationwide volunteers must be hiv infected but have no symptoms of hiv disease hhs secretary donna e shalala said this initial study can be seen as a hopeful milestone in our efforts to ameliorate the tragedy of hiv infected children who now face the certainty they will develop aids anthony s fauci m d director of the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases and of the nih office of aids research said the trial is the first step in finding out whether vaccines can help prevent or delay disease progression in children with hiv who are not yet sick if these vaccines prove to be safe more sophisticated questions about their therapeutic potential will be assessed in phase ii trials the centers for disease control and prevention estimates children in the united states have hiv by the end of the decade the world health organization projects million children will be infected worldwide the study will enroll children ages month to years old niaid which funds the aids clinical trials group network anticipates conducting the trial at nine actg sites around the country and three sites participating in the actg but funded by the national institute of child health and human development preliminary evidence from similar studies under way in infected adults shows that certain vaccines can boost existing hiv specific immune responses and hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april stimulate new ones it will be several years however before researchers know how these responses affect the clinical course of the disease the results from the pediatric trial known as actg will be examined closely for other reasons as well this trial will provide the first insight into how the immature immune system responds to candidate hiv vaccines said daniel hoth m d director of niaid s division of aids we need this information to design trials to test whether experimental vaccines can prevent hiv infection in children in the united states most hiv infected children live in poor inner city areas and more than percent are minorities mainly black or hispanic nearly all hiv infected children acquire the virus from their mothers during pregnancy or at birth an infected mother in the united states has more than a one in four chance of transmitting the virus to her baby as growing numbers of women of childbearing age become exposed to hiv through injection drug use or infected sexual partners researchers expect a corresponding increase in the numbers of infected children hiv disease progresses more rapidly in infants and children than in adults the most recent information suggests that percent of infants born with hiv develop a serious aids related infection by to years of age these infections include severe or frequent bouts of common bacterial illnesses of childhood that can result in seizures pneumonia diarrhea and other symptoms leading to nutritional problems and long hospital stays at least half of the children in the trial will be years of age or younger to enable comparison of the immune responses of the younger and older participants all volunteers must have well documented hiv infection but no symptoms of hiv disease other than swollen lymph glands or a mildly swollen liver or spleen they cannot have received any anti retroviral or immune regulating drugs within one month prior to their entry into the study study chair john s lambert m d of the university of rochester medical school and co chair samuel katz m d of duke university school of medicine will coordinate the trial assisted by james mcnamara m d medical officer in the pediatric medicine branch of niaid s division of aids we will compare the safety of the vaccines by closely monitoring the children for any side effects to see if one vaccine produces more swollen arms or fevers for example than another said dr mcnamara we ll also look at whether low or high doses of the vaccines stimulate immune responses or other significant laboratory or clinical effects he emphasized that the small study size precludes comparing these responses or effects among the three hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april products the trial will test two doses each of three experimental vaccines made from recombinant hiv proteins these so called subunit vaccines each genetically engineered to contain only a piece of the virus have so far proved well tolerated in ongoing trials in hiv infected adults one vaccine made by microgenesys inc of meriden conn contains gp a protein that gives rise to hiv s surface proteins plus alum adjuvant adjuvants boost specific immune responses to a vaccine presently alum is the only adjuvant used in human vaccines licensed by the food and drug administration both of the other vaccines one made by genentech inc of south san francisco and the other by biocine a joint venture of chiron and ciba geigy in emeryville calif contain the major hiv surface protein gp plus adjuvant the genentech vaccine contains alum while the biocine vaccine contains mf an experimental adjuvant that has proved safe and effective in other phase i vaccine trials in adults a low dose of each product will be tested first against a placebo in children twelve children will be assigned at random to be immunized with the experimental vaccine and three children will be given adjuvant alone considered the placebo neither the health care workers nor the children will be told what they receive if the low dose is well tolerated controlled testing of a higher dose of the experimental vaccine and adjuvant placebo in another group of children will begin each child will receive

page volume number april new evidence that the hiv can cause disease independently news from the national institute of dental research there is new evidence that the human immunodeficiency virus can cause disease independently of its ability to suppress the immune system say scientists at the national institues of health they report that hiv itself not an opportunistic infection caused scaling skin conditions to develop in mice carrying the genes for hiv although the hiv genes were active in the mice they did not compromise the animals immunity the researchers found this led them to conclude that the hiv itself caused the skin disease our findings support a growing body of evidence that hiv can cause disease without affecting the immune system said lead author dr jeffrey kopp of the national institute of dental research nidr dr kopp and his colleagues described their study in the march issue of aids research and human retroviruses developing animal models of hiv infection has been difficult since most animals including mice cannot be infected by the virus to bypass this problem scientists have developed hiv transgenic mice which carry genes for hiv as well as their own genetic material nidr scientists created the transgenic mice by injecting hiv genes into mouse eggs and then implanting the eggs into female mice the resulting litters contained both normal and transgenic animals institute scientists had created mice that carried a complete copy of hiv genetic material in l those mice however became sick and died too soon after birth to study in depth in the present study the scientists used an incomplete copy of hiv which allowed the animals to live longer some of the transgenic animals developed scaling wart like tumors on their necks and backs other transgenic mice developed thickened crusting skin lesions that covered most of their bodies resembling psoriasis in humans no skin lesions developed in their normal non transgenic littermates studies of tissue taken from the wart like skin tumors showed that they were a type of noncancerous tumor called papilloma although the papillomavirus can cause these skin lesions laboratory tests showed no sign of that virus in the animals tissue samples taken from the sick mice throughout the study revealed the presence of a protein producing molecule made by the hiv genetic material hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april evidence of hiv protein production proved that the viral genes were turned on or active said dr kopp the scientists found no evidence however of compromised immunity in the mice no increase in their white blood cell count and no signs of common infections the fact that hiv genes were active but the animals immune systems were not suppressed confirms that the virus itself was causing the skin lesions dr kopp said further proof of hiv gene involvement came from a test in which the scientists exposed the transgenic animals to ultraviolet light the light increased hiv genetic activity causing papillomas to develop on formerly healthy skin papilloma formation in response to increased hiv genetic activity proved the genes were responsible for the skin condition the scientists said no lesions appeared on normal mice exposed to the uv light the transgenic mice used in this study were developed at nidr by dr peter dickie who is now with the national institute of allergy and infectious diseases collaborating on the study with dr kopp were mr charles wohlenberg drs nickolas dorfman joseph bryant abner notkins and paul klotman all of nidr dr stephen

other health care professionals who have questions about providing care to people with hiv infection or aids the toll free national hiv telephone consulting service is staffed by a physician a nurse practitioner and a pharmacist it provides information on drugs clinical trials and the latest treatment methods the service is funded by the health resources and services administration and operates out of san francisco general hospital secretary shalala said one goal of this project is to share expertise so patients get the best care a second goal is to get more primary health care providers involved in care for people with hiv or aids which reduces treatment cost by allowing patients to remain with their medical providers and community social support networks currently many providers refer patients with hiv or aids to specialists or other providers who have more experience secretary shalala said this clinical expertise should be especially helpful for physicians and providers who

purchased this week thank you to the following individuals whose contributions i just received john sorenson carol sigelman carla moore barbara moose judith schrier again thank you to all who gave i have been using wordscan plus for the past couple of weeks and would like to review the product wordscan plus is a product of calera recognition systems it runs under windows and supports that accufont technology of the hewlett packard scanners when initially bringing up the software it lets you select several options text graphics input source ie scanner fax file disk file automatic versus manual decomposition of the scanned image i like manual decomposition since the software then lets me select which parts of the document i would like scanned and in what order once an image is scanned you can bring up the pop up image verification the software gives you two errors at this point blue which are words that were converted reliability but do not match anything in the built in dictionary yellow shade which are words that wordscan plus doesn t think it converted correctly at all i have found that the software should give itself more credit it is usually correct instead of wrong if a word is shaded blue you can add it to your personal dictionary the only problem is the personal dictionary will only handle about words i find this to be very limited considering how many medical terms are not in a normal dictionary after a document is converted you can save it in a multitude of word processor formats also any images that were captured can be stored in a seperate tiff or pcx file format i was extremely impressed on the percent accuracy for fax files i use hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april an intel satisfaxtion card which stores incoming faxs in a pcx dcx format while most of my faxes were received in standard mode x dpi the accuracy of wordscan plus was excellent overall a very impressive product the only fault i could find is the limitations of the size of the user dictionary specialized words is just too small if anyone has any specific questions please do not hesitate to send me email hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april centers

public health problem infectious diseases remain the major cause of death worldwide and a leading cause of illness and death in the united states since the early s the u s public health system has been challenged by a myriad of newly identified pathogens and syndromes e g escherichia coli o h hepatitis c virus human immunodeficiency virus legionnaires disease lyme disease and toxic shock syndrome the incidences of many diseases widely presumed to be under control such as cholera malaria and tuberculosis tb have increased in many areas furthermore control and prevention of infectious diseases are undermined by drug resistance in conditions such as gonorrhea malaria pneumococcal disease salmonellosis shigellosis tb and staphylococcal infections emerging infections place a disproportionate burden on immunocompromised persons those in institutional settings e g hospitals and child day care centers and minority and underserved populations the substantial economic burden of emerging infections on the u s health care system could be reduced by more effective surveillance systems and targeted control and prevention programs this issue of mmwr introduces a new series

center for infectious diseases cdc editorial note e coli o h is a pathogenic gram negative bacterium first identified as a cause of illness in during an outbreak of severe bloody diarrhea traced to contaminated hamburgers this pathogen has since emerged as an important cause of both bloody diarrhea and hus the most common cause of acute renal failure in children outbreak investigations have linked most cases with the consumption of undercooked ground beef although other food vehicles including roast beef raw milk and apple cider also have been implicated preliminary data from a cdc year nationwide multicenter study revealed that when stools were routinely cultured for e coli o h that organism was isolated more frequently than shigella in four of participating hospitals and was isolated from of all bloody stools a higher rate than for any other pathogen infection with e coli o h often is not recognized because most clinical laboratories do not routinely culture stools for this organism on hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april smac medium and many clinicians are unaware of the spectrum of illnesses associated with infection the usual clinical manifestations are diarrhea often bloody and abdominal cramps fever is infrequent younger age groups and the elderly are at highest risk for clinical manifestations and complications illness usually resolves after days but of patients develop hus which is characterized by hemolytic anemia thrombocytopenia renal failure and a death rate of this report illustrates the difficulties in recognizing community outbreaks of e coli o h in the absence of routine surveillance despite the magnitude of this outbreak the problem may not have been recognized in three states if the epidemiologic link had not been established in washington clinical laboratories should routinely culture stool specimens from persons with bloody diarrhea or hus for e coli o h using smac agar when infections with e coli o h are identified they should be reported to local health departments for further evaluation and if necessary public health action to prevent further cases e coli o h lives in the intestines of healthy cattle and can contaminate meat during slaughter cdc is collaborating with the u s department of agriculture s food safety inspection service to identify critical control points in processing as a component of a program to reduce the likelihood of pathogens such as e coli o h entering the meat supply because slaughtering practices can result in contamination of raw meat with pathogens and because the process of grinding beef may transfer pathogens from the surface of the meat to the interior ground beef is likely to be internally contaminated the optimal food protection practice is to cook ground beef thoroughly until the interior is no longer pink and the juices are clear in this outbreak undercooking of hamburger patties likely played an important role the food and drug administration fda has issued interim recommendations to increase the internal temperature for cooked hamburgers to f c fda personal communication regulatory actions stimulated by the outbreak described in this report and the recovery of thousands of contaminated patties before they could be consumed emphasize the value of rapid public health investigations of outbreaks the public health impact and increasing frequency of isolation of this pathogen underscore the need for improved surveillance for infections caused by e coli o h and for hus to better define the epidemiology of e coli

particles linked to serious asthma attacks american lung association a new study published by the american lung association has shown that surprisingly low concentrations of airborne particles can send people with asthma rushing to emergency rooms for treatment the seattle based study showed that roughly one in eight emergency visits for asthma in that city was linked to exposure to particulate air pollution the actual exposure levels recorded in the study were far below those deemed unsafe under federal air quality laws people with asthma have inflamed airways and airborne particles tend to exacerbate that inflammation said joel schwartz ph d of the environmental protection agency who was the lead author of the study when people are on the threshold of having a serious asthma attack particles can push them over the edge the seattle study correlated months of asthma emergency room visits with daily levels of pm or particulate matter with an aerodynamic diameter of microns or less these finer particles are considered hazardous because they are small enough penetrate into the lung cities are considered out of compliance with clean air laws if the hour average concentration of pm exceeds micrograms per cubic millimeter of air in seattle however a link between fine particles and asthma was found at levels as low as micrograms the authors concluded that for every microgram increase in the four day average of pm the odds of someone with asthma needing emergency treatment increased by percent the findings were published in the april american review of respiratory disease an official journal of the american thoracic society the lung association s medical section the study is the latest in a series of recent reports to suggest that particulate matter is a greatly under appreciated health threat a study by dr schwartz and douglas dockery ph d of harvard found that particles may be causing roughly premature deaths each year in the united states other studies have linked particulate matter to increased respiratory symptoms and bronchitis in children government officials and the media are still very focused on ozone says dr schwartz but more and more research is showing that particles are bad actors as well one problem in setting standards for particulate air pollution is that pmio is difficult to study unlike other regulated pollutants such as ozone and carbon monoxide particulate matter is a complex and varying mixture of substances including carbon hydrocarbons dust and hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april acid aerosols researchers can t put people in exposure chambers to study the effects of particulate air pollution says dr schwartz we have no way of duplicating the typical urban mix of particles consequently most of what is known about particulates has been learned through population based research like the seattle study given that the epa s current priority is to review the ozone and sulfur dioxide standards the agency is unlikely to reexamine the pm standard any time soon until changes are made there appears to be little people with asthma can do to protect themselves from airborne particles in some areas you can get reports on air quality but the reports only cover the pollutant that is closest to violating its standard and that s rarely particulate matter says dr schwartz however pm doesn t have to be near its violation range to be unhealthy hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april nih consensus development conference on melanoma the national institutes of health consensus development

medical newsletter page volume number april nci designated cancer centers the cancer centers program is comprised of nci designated cancer centers actively engaged in multidisciplinary research efforts to reduce cancer incidence morbidity and mortality within the program there are four types of cancer centers basic science cancer centers which engage primarily in basic cancer research clinical cancer centers which focus on clinical research comprehensive cancer centers which emphasize a multidisciplinary approach to cancer research patient care and community outreach and consortium cancer centers which specialize in cancer prevention and control research although some cancer centers existed in the late s and the s it was the national cancer act of that authorized the establishment of new cancer centers as well as continuing support for existing ones the passage of the act also dramatically transformed the centers structure and broadened the scope of their mission to include all aspects of basic clinical and cancer control research over the next two decades the centers program grew progressively in there were comprehensive cancer centers in the nation today there are of these institutions all of which meet specific nci criteria for comprehensive status to attain recognition from the nci as a comprehensive cancer center an institution must pass rigorous peer review under guidelines newly established in the eight criteria for comprehensiveness include the requirement that a center have a strong core of basic laboratory research in several scientific fields such as biology and molecular genetics a strong program of clinical research and an ability to transfer research findings into clinical practice moreover five of the criteria for comprehensive status go significantly beyond that required for attaining a cancer center support grant also referred to as a p or core grant the mechanism of choice for supporting the infrastructure of a cancer center s operations these criteria encompass strong participation in nci designated high priority clinical trials significant levels of cancer prevention and control research and important outreach and educational activities all of which are funded by a variety of sources the other types of cancer centers also have special characteristics and capabilities for organizing new programs of research that can exploit important new findings or address timely research questions hicnet medical newsletter page volume number april of the nci designated cancer centers are of the basic science type these centers engage almost entirely in basic research although some centers engage in collaborative research with outside clinical research investigators and in cooperative projects with industry to generate medical applications from new discoveries in the laboratory clinical cancer centers in contrast focus on both basic research and clinical research within the same institutional framework and frequently incorporate nearby affiliated clinical research institutions into their overall research programs there are such centers today finally consortium cancer centers of which there is one are uniquely structured and concentrate on clinical research and cancer prevention and control research these centers interface with state and local public health departments for the purpose of achieving the transfer of effective prevention and control techniques from their research findings to those institutions responsible for implementing population wide public health programs consortium centers also are heavily engaged in collaborations with institutions that conduct clinical trial research and coordinate community hospitals within a network of cooperating institutions in clinical trials together the nci designated cancer centers continue to work toward creating new and innovative approaches to cancer research and through interdisciplinary efforts to effectively move this research

vaccine administration sources said thursday the decision ends the controversy between army aids researchers who had hoped to test a vaccine made by microgenesys inc and the national institutes of health which contended that multiple vaccines should be tested health and human services secretary donna shalala said a final announcement on the therapeutic vaccine trials was expected to be made last friday companies including genentech inc chiron corp and immuno ag have already told nih that they are prepared to participate in the vaccine tests the testing is intended to demonstrate whether aids vaccines are effective in thwarting the replication of hiv in patients already infected shalala refuted last week s reports that the clinton administration had decided the army s test of the microgenesys vaxsyn should proceed without tests of others at the same time the report was inaccurate and i expect there to be some announcement in the next hours about that particular aids research project said shalala administration sources subsequently confirmed that nih director dr bernadine healy and food and drug administration commissioner david kessler had convinced the white house that multiple vaccines should be tested simultaneously but microgenesys president frank volvovitz said a test of multiple vaccines could triple the cost of the trial and delay it by two years hicnet

positive patients taking azt demonstrated a slightly lower risk of developing aids within the first year of treatment that benefit disappeared two years later the lancet published preliminary findings of the three year study which could give more reason for critics to argue the drug s cost side effects and general efficacy even though u s researchers concede the study was more comprehensive than

noordewier rutgers university this overview of the essential facts of molecular biology is intended as an introduction to the field for computer scientists who wish to apply their tools to this rich and complex domain material covered will include structural and informational molecules the basic organization of the cell and of genetic material the central dogma of gene expression and selected other topics in the area of structure function and regulation as relates to current computational approaches dr noordewier has appointments in both computer science and biology at rutgers and has extensive experience in basic biological research in addition to his current work in computational biology pm introduction to artificial intelligence for biologists dr richard lathrop mit arris corp an overview of the field of artificial intelligence will be presented as it relates to actual and potential biological applications fundamental techniques symbolic programming languages and notions of search will be discussed as well as selected topics in somewhat greater detail such as knowledge representation inference and machine learning the intended audience includes biologists with some computational background but no extensive exposure to artificial intelligence dr lathrop co developer of ariadne and related technologies has worked in the area of artificial intelligence applied to biological problems in both academia and industry pm neural networks statistics and information theory in biological sequence analysis dr alan lapedes los alamos national laboratory this tutorial will cover the most rapidly expanding facet of intelligent systems for molecular biology that of machine learning techniques applied to sequence analysis closely interrelated topics to be addressed include the use of artifical neural networks to elicit both specific signals and general characteristics of sequences and the relationship of such approaches to statistical techniques and information theoretic views of sequence data dr lapedes of the theoretical division at los alamos has long been a leader in the use of such techniques in this domain pm genetic algorithms and genetic programming prof john koza stanford university the genetic algorithm an increasingly popular approach to highly non linear multi dimensional optimization problems was originally inspired by a biological metaphor this tutorial will cover both the biological motivations and the actual implementation and characteristics of the algorithm genetic programming an extension well suited to problems where the discovery of the size and shape of the solution is a major part of the problem will also be addressed particular attention will be paid to biological applications and to identifying resources and software that will permit attendees to begin using the methods dr koza a consulting professor of computer science at stanford has taught this subject since and is the author of a standard text in the field pm linguistic methods in sequence analysis prof david searls university of pennsylvania shmuel pietrokovski weizmann institute approaches to sequence analysis based on linguistic methodologies are increasingly in evidence these involve the adaptation of tools and techniques from computational linguistics for syntactic pattern recognition and gene prediction the classification of genetic structures and phenomena using formal language theory the identification of significant vocabularies and overlapping codes in sequence data and sequence comparison reflecting taxonomic and functional relatedness dr searls who holds research faculty appointments in both genetics and computer science at penn represents the branch of this field that considers higher order syntactic approaches to sequence data while shmuel pietrokovski has studied and published with prof edward trifinov in the area of word based analyses registration form mail with check made out to ismb to ismb conference c o

4247###sci.med###candida yeast bloom fact or fiction i can not believe the way this thread on candida yeast has progressed steve dyer and i have been exchanging words over the same topic in sci med nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a women poster for being treated by a liscenced physician for a disease that did not exist calling this physician a quack was reprehensible steve and i see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well let me tell you who the quacks really are these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with it s environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics these are the physicians who dismiss their patients with difficult symptomatology and make them go from doctor to doctor to find relief like elaine in sci med nutrition and then when they find one that solves their problem the rest start yelling quack could it just be professional jealousy i couldn t help elaine or jon but somebody else did could they know more than me no way they must be a quack i ve been teaching a human nutrition course for medical students for over ten years now and guess who the most receptive students are those that were raised on farms and saw first hand the effect of diet on the health of their farm animals and those students who had made a dramatic diet change prior to entering medical school switched to the vegan diet typically this is about of my class of students those not interested in nutrition either tune me out or just stop coming to class that s okay because i know that some of what i m teaching is going to stick and there will be at least a few enlightened physicians practicing in the u s it s really too bad that most u s medical schools don t cover nutrition because if they did candida would not be viewed as a non disease by so many in the medical profession in animal husbandry an animal is reinnoculated with good bacteria after antibiotics are stopped medicine has decided that since humans do not have a ruminant stomach no such reinnoculation with good bacteria is needed after coming off a braod spectrum antibiotic humans have all kinds of different organisms living in the gi system mouth stomach small and large intestine sinuses vagina and on the skin these are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised they are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body but any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body a poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin a is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier steve got real upset with elaine s doctor because he was using anti fungals and vitamin a for her gi problems if steve really understoood what vitamin a does in the body he would not or at least should not be calling elaine s doctor a quack here is a brief primer on yeast yeast infections as they are commonly called are not truely caused by yeasts the most common organism responsible for this type of infection is candida albicans or monilia which is actually a yeast like fungus an infection caused by this organism is called candidiasis candidiasis is a very rare occurance because like an e coli infection it requires that the host immune system be severly depressed candida is frequently found on the skin and all of the mucous membranes of normal healthy people and it rarely becomes a problem unless some predisposing factor is present such as a high blood glucose level diabetes or an oral course of antibiotics has been used in diabetics their secretions contain much higher amounts of glucose candida unlike bacteria is very limited in it s food fuel selection without glucose it can not grow it just barely survives if it gets access to a lot of glucose it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses gi tract or vagina in diabetics skin lesions can also foster a good bloom site for these little buggers the bloom is usually just a minor irritant in most people but some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not isn t certain when the bloom is in the vagina or on the skin it can be easliy seen and some doctors do then try to treat it if it s internal only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondiscript candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses the gi tract mouth stomach and intestines and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food the human immune system ususally does not bother itself with these nonpathogenic organisms unless they broach the mucus membrane barrier if they do an inflammatory response will be set up most americans are not getting enough vitamin a from their diets about of all american s die with less vitamin a than they were born with u s autopsy studies while this low level of vitamin a does not cause pathology blindness it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system this would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom while diabetics can suffer from a candida bloom the most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned while drugs are available to handle candida many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection the toxicity of the anti fungal drugs does warrant some caution but if the gi or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candida and recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun then anti fungal use should be approrpriate just as the anti fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections in spite of what mr steve dyer says but even in patients being given the anti fungals the irritation caused by the excessive candida bloom in the sinus gi tract or the vagina tends to return after drug treatment is discontinued unless the underlying cause of the problem is addressed lack of a good bacterial flora in the body and or poor mucus membrane barrier lactobacillus acidophilus is the most effective therapy for candida overgrowth from it s name it is an acid loving organism and it sets up an acidic condition were it grows candida can not grow very well in an acidic environment in the vagina l acidophilius is the predominate bacteria unless you are hit with broad spectrum antibiotics in the gi system the ano rectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer through moisture and humidity of candida to the vaginal tract one of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear if the bloom occurs in the anal area the burning swelling pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids if the bloom manages to move further up the gi tract very diffuse symptomatology occurs abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool this positive stool for occult blood is what sent elaine to her family doctor in the first place after extensive testing he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt on to another doctor and so on richard kaplan has told me throiugh e mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positives candida blooms guys if my gut hurt me on a constant basis i would want it fixed yes it s nice to know that i don t have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress when i finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me better steve dyer calls him a quack candida prefers a slightly alkaline environment while bacteria tend to prefer a slightly acidic environment the vagina becomes alkaline during a woman s period and this is often when candida blooms in the vagina vinegar and water douches are the best way of dealing with vaginal problems many women have also gotten relief from the introduction of lactobacillus directly into the vaginal tract i would want to be sure of the purity of the product before trying this my wife had this vagina problem after going on birth control pills and searched for over a year until she found a gynocologist who solved the problem rather than just writting scripts for anti fungal creams this was a woman gynocologist who had had the same problem recurring vaginal yeast infections this m d did some digging and came up with an acetic acid and l acidophilis douche which she used in your office to keep it sterile after three treatments sex returned to our marraige i have often wondered what an m d with chronic gi distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a non existent syndrome the nonpathogenic bacteria l acidophilus is an acid producing bacteria which is the most common bacteria found in the vaginal tract of healthy women if taken orally it can also become a major bacteria in the gut through aresol sprays it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes but before this innoculation occurs the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened this is accomplished by vitamin a vitamin c and some of the b complex vitamins diet surveys repeatedly show that americans are not getting enough b and folate these are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this non existent disorder candida blooms after antibiotic therapy some of the above material was obtained from natural healing by mark bricklin published by rodale press as well as notes from my human nutrition course i will be posting a discussion of vitamin a sometime in the future along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin a plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin a should be effective in dealing with candida blooms another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase this is especially important if the gi system is involved if candida can not get glucose it s not going to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate is returned to the gut if steve and some of the other nay sayers want to jump all over this post fine i jumped all over steve in sci med nutrition because he verbably accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor s use of vitamin a and anti fungals for a candida bloom in her gut people seeking advice from newsnet should not be treated this way those of us giving of our time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart s content

the replies if any will be med related in article banschbach vms ocom okstate edu writes i can not believe the way this thread on candida yeast has progressed steve dyer and i have been exchanging words over the same topic in sci med nutrition when he displayed his typical reserve and attacked a woman poster for being treated by a licenced physician for a disease that did not exist calling this physician a quack was reprehensible steve and i see that you and some of the others are doing it here as well they are just responding in their natural way hyper choleric syndrome hcs oops that is not a recognized illness in the psychological community better not say that since it therefore must not and never will exist actually it is fascinating that a disproportionate number of physicians will type out as nt for those not familiar with the myers briggs system just e mail me and i ll send a summary file to you in the general population nt s comprise only about of the population but among physicians it is much much higher i don t know the exact percentage any help here a p p er s one driving characteristic of an nt especially an ntj is their obvious choleric behavior driver type a etc the extreme emotional need to control to lead and or to be the best or the most competent if they are also extroverted they are best described as field marshalls this trait is very valuable and essential in our society we need people who want to lead to strive to overcome the elements to seek and thirst for knowledge to raise the level of competency etc the great successes in science and technology are in large part due to the vision an n trait and scientifically minded approach t trait of the nt personality of course the other types and temperaments have their own positive contributions as well however when the nt person has self image challenges the dark side of this personality type usually comes out which should be obvious to all a physician who is a strong nt and who has not learned to temper their temperament will be extremely business like lack of empathy or feeling and is very compelled to have total control over their patient the patient must be obedient to their diagnosis and prescription without question i ve known many m d s of this temperament and suffice to say i don t oblige them with a followup visit no matter how competent i think they are and they usually are very competent from a knowledge viewpoint since that is an extreme drive of theirs to know the most to know it all maybe we need more nf doctor s enough on this subject let s move on to candida bloom let me tell you who the quacks really are these are the physicans who have no idea how the human body interacts with it s environment and how that balance can be altered by diet and antibiotics could it just be professional jealousy i couldn t help elaine or jon but somebody else did you ve helped me already by your post of course i believe that i have been misdiagnosed on the net as suffering from anal retentivitis but being the phlegmatic i am maybe i was just a little too harsh on a few people myself in past posts let s all try to raise the level of this discussion above the level of anal effluent humans have all kinds of different organisms living in the gi system mouth stomach small and large intestine sinuses vagina and on the skin these are nonpathogenic because they do not cause disease in people unless the immune system is compromised they are also called nonpathogens because unlike the pathogenic organisms that cause human disease they do not produce toxins as they live out their merry existence in and on our body but any of these organisms will be considered pathogenic if it manages to take up residence within the body a poor mucus membrane barrier can let this happen and vitamin a is mainly responsible for setting up this barrier in my well described situation in prior posts i definitely was immune stressed blood tests showed my vitamin a levels were very low my sinuses were a mess no doubt the mucosal lining and the cilia were heavily damaged i also was on antibiotics times in years in the end even two weeks of ceftin did not work and i had confirmed diagnoses of a chronic bacterial infection of the sinuses via cat scans mucus color won t get into the details and other symptoms three very traditional ent s made this diagnosis i did not have any cultures done however because of the difficulty of doing this right and because my other symptoms clearly showed a bacterial infection enough of this background provided to help you understand where i was when i make comments about my sporanox anti fungal therapy below the first question i have is this can fungus penetrate a little way into poor mucus membrane tissue maybe via hyphae thus causing symptoms without being considered systemic in the classic sense it is sort of an inbetween infection steve got real upset with elaine s doctor because he was using anti fungals and vitamin a for her gi problems if steve really understoood what vitamin a does in the body he would not or at least should not be calling elaine s doctor a quack i was concerned too because of the toxicity of vitamin a my doctor after my blood tests put me on iu of vitamin a for one week only then dropped it down to iu for the next couple of weeks i also received zinc and other supplementation since all of these interrelate in fairly complex ways as my doctor explained he s one of those evil orthomolecular specialists i had a blood test three weeks later and vitamin a was normal he then stopped me on all vitamin a except for some in a multi vitamin supplement and made sure that i maintain a iu day of beta carotene call me carrot face hopefully elaine s doctor will take a similar careful approach and to all supplements i m even reevaluating some supplements i m taking for example niacin in fairly large dosages gram day which steve dyer had good information about on sci med nutrition if niacin only has second order improvement in symptomatic relief of my sinus allergies then it probably is not worth taking such a large dose long term and risking liver damage survives if it gets access to a lot of glucose it blooms and over rides the other organisms living with it in the sinuses gi tract or vagina in though i do now believe based on my successful therapy with sporanox that i definitely had some excessive growth of fungus unknown species in my sinuses i still want to ask the question have there been any studies that demonstrate candida blooms in the sinuses with associated sinus irritation sinusitis rhinitis my sinus irritation reduced significantly after one week of sporanox and no other new treatments were implemented during this time i did not have any noticeable gi track problems before starting on sporanox but some for a few days after which then went away considered normal btw my doctor dug out one of his medical reference books sorry can t remember which one and found an obscure comment dating back into the s which stated that people can develop contained non lethal or non serious aspergillis infestations aspergiliosis of the sinuses leading to sinus inflammation symptoms i ll have to dig out that reference again since it is relevant to this discussion some people do really develop a bad inflammatory process at the mucus membrane or skin bloom site whether this is an allergic like reaction to the candida or not isn t certain my doctor tested me i believe a rast or rast similar test for allergic response to specificially candida albicans and i showed a strong positive another question would everybody show the same strong positive so this test is essentially useless and assuming it is true that candida can grow part way into the mucus membrane tissue and the concentration exceeds a threshold amount could not a person who tests as having an allergy to candida definitely develop allergic symptoms such as mucus membrane irritation due to the body s allergic response as i said in an earlier post one does not need to be a rocket scientist or have a m d degree or a ph d in biochemistry to see the plausibility of this hypothesis btw and i ll repost this again dr ivker in his book sinus survival has routinely given before anything else nizoral a pre sporanox systemic anti fungal not as safe and not as good as sporanox to his new chronic sinusitis patients if they have been on antibiotics four or more times in the last two years he claims that out of or so patients well over notice some relief of sinus inflammation and other symptoms but it doesn t cure it by any means implying the so called yeast fungus infection is not the primary cause but a later complication he s also found that nystatin whether taken internally or put into a sinus spray does not help this implies of course assuming that excessive yeast fungus bloom is aggravating the sinus inflammation that the yeast fungus has grown partway into the tissue since nystatin will not kill yeast fungus other than by direct contact it is not absorbed into the blood stream again i admit lots of ifs and implies which doesn t please the hard core nt who has to have the double blind study or it s a non issue but one has to start with some plausible hypothesis explanation a strawman if you will if it s internal only symptoms can be used and these symptoms are pretty nondescript this brings up an interesting observation used by those who will deny and reject any and all aspects of the yeast hypothesis until the appropriate studies are done and that is if you can t observe or culture the yeast bloom in the gut or sinus then there s no way to diagnose or even recognize the disease and i know they realize that it is virtually impossible to test for candida overbloom in any part of the body that cannot be easily observed since candida is everywhere in the body it s a real catch another catch those who totally reject the yeast hypothesis say that no studies have been done actually studies have been done but if it s not up to a certain standard then it is from their perspective a non study which should not even be considered i agree that the appropriate studies should be done and that will take big to do it right however in order to convince the funding agencies in these austere times to open their wallets you literally have to give them evidence and the only acceptable evidence to compete with other proposals is paradoxically to do almost the exact study needed funding that is you have to do of the study before you even get funding as a scientist at a national lab i m very aware of this for the smaller funded projects i m afraid that even if dr ivker and other doctors got together pooled their practice s case histories and anecdotes into a compelling picture and approach the funding agencies they would get nowhere even if they were able to publish their statistical results it is obvious from the comments by some of the doctors here is that they have decided excessive yeast colonization in the gut or sinuses leading to noticeable non lethal symptoms does not exist and is not even a tenable hypothesis so any amount of case histories or compiled anecdotal evidence to the contrary will never change their mind and not only that they would also oppose the needed studies because in their minds it s a done issue excessive yeast growth leading to diffuse allergic symptoms does not will not and cannot exist period kind of tough to dialog with those who hold such a viewpoint kind of reminds me of lister candida is kept in check in most people by the normal bacterial flora in the sinuses the gi tract mouth stomach and intestines and in the vaginal tract which compete with it for food the human immune system ususally does not bother itself with these nonpathogenic organisms unless they broach the mucus membrane barrier if they do an inflammatory response will be set up most americans are not getting enough vitamin a from their diets about of all american s die with less vitamin a than they were born with u s autopsy studies while this low level of vitamin a does not cause pathology blindness it does impair the mucus membrane barrier system this would then be a predisposing factor for a strong inflammatory response after a candida bloom aren t there also other nutrients necessary to the proper working of the sinus mucus membranes and cilia while diabetics can suffer from a candida bloom the most common cause of this type of bloom is the use of broad spectrum antibiotics which knock down many different kinds of bacteria in the body and remove the main competition for candida as far as food is concerned while drugs are available to handle candida many patients find that their doctor will not use them unless there is evidence of a systemic infection the toxicity of the anti fungal drugs does warrant some caution but if the gi or sinus inflammation is suspected to be candida and recent use of a broad spectrum antibiotic is the smoking gun then anti fungal use should be approrpriate just as the anti fungal creams are an appropriate treatment for recurring vaginal yeast infections in spite of what mr steve dyer says again the evidence from mycological studies indicate that many yeast fungus species can grow hyphae roots into deep tissue similar to mold growing in bread you can continue to kill the surface such as nystatin does but you can t kill that which is deeper in the tissue without using a systemic anti fungal such as itraconazole sporanox or some of the older ones such as nizoral which are more toxic and not as effective this is why as has been pointed out by recent studies sent to me by a doctor i ve been in e mail contact with thanks that nystatin is not effective in the long term treatment of gi tract candidiasis it s like trying to weed a garden by cutting off what s above the ground but leaving the roots ready to come out again once you walk away the question is whether a contained candida bloom can partially grow into tissue through the mucus membranes causing some types of symptoms in susceptible people e g allergy without becoming systemic in the classical sense of the word something in between strictly an excessive bloom not causing any problems and the full blown systemic infection that is potentially lethal in the gi system the ano rectal region seems to be a particularly good reservoir for candida and the use of pantyhose by many women creates a very favorable environment around the rectum for transfer through moisture and humidity of candida to the vaginal tract one of the most effctive ways to minimmize this transfer is to wear undyed cotton underwear also if one is an anal retentive like i ve been diagnosed in a prior post that can also provide more sites for excessive candida growth if the bloom occurs in the anal area the burning swelling pain and even blood discharge make many patients think that they have hemorroids if the bloom manages to move further up the gi tract very diffuse symptomatology occurs abdominal discomfort and blood in the stool this positive stool for occult blood is what sent elaine to her family doctor in the first place after extensive testing he told her that there was nothing wrong but her gut still hurt on to another doctor and so on richard kaplan has told me throiugh e mail that he considers occult blood tests in stool specimens to be a waste of time and money because of the very large number of false positives candida blooms guys if my gut hurt me on a constant basis i would want it fixed yes it s nice to know that i don t have colon cancer but what then is causing my distress when i finally find a doctor who treats me and gets me better steve dyer calls him a quack as i ve said in private e mail there are flaws in our current medical system that make it difficult or even impossible for a physician to attempt alternative therapies after the approved proven accepted therapies don t work for example i went to three ent s who all said that i will just have to live with my acute chronic sinusitis after the ab s failed they did mention surgery to open up the ostia but my ostia weren t plugged and it would not get to the root cause of my condition after three months of aggressive and fairly non standard therapy sporanox body nutrient level monitoring and equalization vitamin c lentinen echinacea etc my health has vastly improved to where i was two years ago before my health greatly deteriorated of course skeptics would say that maybe if i did nothing i would have improved anyway but that view is stretching things quite far because of the experience of the three ent s i saw who said that i d just have to live with it i m confident i will reach what one could call a total cure the anti fungal program i undertook was one necessary step in that direction because of my overuse of ab s for the last four years note for those having sinus problems may i suggest the book by dr ivker i mention above be sure to get the revised edition i have often wondered what an m d with chronic gi distress or sinus problems would do about the problem that he tells his patients is a non existent syndrome dr ivker started off having chronic and severe sinus problems and his visits to several ent s totally floored him when they said you ll just have to live with it he spent several years trying everything standard and non standard until he was essentially cured of chronic sinusitis he now shares his approach in his book and i can honestly say that i am on the road to recovery following some parts of it his one recommendation to take a systemic anti fungal at the beginning of treatment if you have a history of anti biotic overuse has been proven to him time and time again in his own practice i m sure if i commented to him of the hard core beliefs of the anti yeast hypothesis posters that he would have definite things to say such as it s worked wonders for me in almost two thousand cases to put it mildly i also would not be surprised if he would say that they are the ones violating their moral obligations to help the patient maybe those doctors who are reading this who have a practice and are confronted by a patient having symptoms that could be due to the hypothetical yeast overgrowth e g they fit some of the profiles the pro yeast people have identified should consider anti fungal therapy if all other avenues have been exhausted remember theory and practice are two different things you cannot have one without the other they are synergistic if a doctor does something non standard yet produces noticeable symptomatic relief in over a thousand of his patients shouldn t you at least sit up and take notice maybe you ought to trust what he says and begin hypothesizing why it works instead of why it shouldn t work i m afraid a lot of doctors have become so enamored with scientific correctness that they are ignoring the patients they have sworn to help you have to do both both have to be balanced which we don t see from some of the posters to this group there comes a point when you just have to use a little common sense and maybe an empirical approach such as trying a good systemic anti fungal such as sporanox after having exhausted all the other avenues i was one of those who the traditional medical establishment was not able to help so i did the natural thing i went to a couple of doctor s who are somewhat outside this establishment and as a result i have found significant relief would it not be better if the traditional medical establishment can set up some kind of mechanism where any doctor without fear of being sued or having his license pulled can try experimental and unproven beyond a doubt therapies for his her patients that finally reach the point where all the accepted therapies are ineffective i d like to hear a doctor tell me well i ve tried all the therapies that are approved and accepted in this country and since they clearly don t work for you i now have the authority to use experimental unproven techniques that seem to have helped others i can t promise anything and there are some risks you will have to sign something saying you understand the experimental and possibly risky nature of these unproven therapies and i ll have to register your case at the state board anyway if my ent had suggested this to me i would ve jumped on this pronto instead of going to one of those doctors who for either altruistic reasons or for greed is practicing these alternative therapies with much risk to him her risk meaning losing their license and possibly to the patient such a mechanism would keep control in the more mainstream medicine and also provide valuable data that would essentially be free it also would be morally and ethically better than the current system by showing the compassion of the medical community to the patient that it s doing everything it can within reason to help the patient it is the lack of such a mechanism that is leading large numbers of people to try alternative therapies some of which seem to work like my case and others of which will never work at all true quackery i better get off my soapbox before this post reaches k in size if taken orally it can also become a major bacteria in the gut through aresol sprays it has also been used to innoculate the sinus membranes but before this innoculation occurs the mucus membrane barrier system needs to be strengthened this is accomplished by vitamin a vitamin c and some of the b complex vitamins diet surveys repeatedly show that americans are not getting enough b and folate these are probably the segement of the population that will have the greatest problem with this non existent disorder candida blooms after antibiotic therapy what dosage of b appears to be necessary to promote the healing and proper working of the mucos memebranes some of the above material was obtained from natural healing by mark bricklin published by rodale press as well as notes from my human nutrition course i will be posting a discussion of vitamin a sometime in the future along with reference citings to point out the extremely important role that vitamin a plays in the mucus membrane defense system in the body and why vitamin a should be effective in dealing with candida blooms another effective dietary treatment is to restrict carbohydrate intake during the treatment phase this is especially important if the gi system is involved if candida can not get glucose it s not going to out grow the bacteria and you then give bacteria which can use amino acids and fatty acids for energy a chance to take over and keep the candida in check once carbohydrate is returned to the gut i d like to see the role of complex carbohydrates such as starch if steve and some of the other nay sayers want to jump all over this post fine i jumped all over steve in sci med nutrition because he verbably accosted a poster who was seeking advice about her doctor s use of vitamin a and anti fungals for a candida bloom in her gut people seeking advice from newsnet should not be treated this way those of us giving of our time and knowledge can slug it out to our heart s content if you saved your venom for me steve and left the helpless posters who are timidly seeking help alone i wouldn t have a problem with your behavior brave soul you are the venom on usenet can be quite toxic unless one develops an immunity

4288###sci.med###how to prevent kidney stone formation i got asked in sci med nutrition about vitamin c and oxalate production toxic kidney stone formation i decided to post my answer here as well because of the recent question about kidney stones not long after i got into sci med i got flamed by a medical fellow for stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation i m going to state it again here but the best way to prevent kidney stones from forming is to take b supplements read on to find out why i have my asbestos suit on now guys vitamin c will form oxalic acid but large doses are needed above grams per day review article nutritional factors in calcium containing kidney stones with particular emphasis on vitamin c int clin nutr rev but glycine also forms oxalic acid d amino acid oxidases for both glycine and vitamin c one of the best ways to drastically reduce this production is not to cut back on dietary intake of vitamin c or glycine but to increase your intake of vitamin b control of hyperoxaluria with large doses of pyridoxine in patients with kidney stones int urol nephrol to mg of b each day significasntly decreased the urinary excretion of oxalate over the month treatment program the action of pyridoxine in primary hyperoxaluria clin sci patients receiving at least mg b each day showed a significant reduction in urinary oxalate levels for gylcine this effect is due to increased transaminase activity b is required for transaminase activity which makes less glycine available for oxidative deamination d amino acid oxidases for vitamin c the effect is quite different there are different pathways for vitamin c catabolism the pathway that leads to oxalic acid formation will usually have to of the ingested dose going into oxalic acid but this is highly variable and the vitamin c review article pointed out that unless the dose gets upto grams per day not too much vitamin c gets catabolized to form oxalic acid at very high doses of vitamin c above grams per day more of the extra vitamin c more than conversion can end up as oxalic acid in a very early study on vitamin c and oxalic production proc soc exp biol med intakes of grams per day up to grams per day increased the average oxalic acid excretion from mg per day up to mg per day until grams per day was reached the average excreted was increased by only to mg per day gram dose gram dose gram dose and gram dose grams jumped it to mg over the average excretion before supplementation and grams jumped it to mg over the average before supplementation b is required by more enzymes than any other vitamin in the body there are probably some enzymes that require vitamin b that we don t know about yet vitamin c catabolism is still not completely understood but the speculation is that this other pathway that does not form oxalic acid must have an enzyme in it that requires b differences in b levels could then explain the very variable production of oxalic acid from a vitamin c challenge this is not the preferred route of catabolism increasing your intake of b would then result in less oxalic acid being formmed if you take vitamin c supplements since the typical american diet is deficient in b some researchers believe that the main cause of calcium oxalate kidney stones is b deficiency especially since so little oxalic acid gets absorbed from the gut diets providing to mg of oxalic acid per day showed absolutely no change in urinary excretion of oxalate urol int if mg was present each day there was a significant increase in urinary oxalate excretion here are the high oxalate foods beans coca instant coffee parsley rhubarb spinach and tea contain at least mg grams beet tops carrots celery chocolate cumber grapefruit kale peanuts pepper sweet potatoe contain to mg grams if the threshold is mg per day you can see that you really have a lot of latitude in food selection a recent n eng j med article also points out that one good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to increase your intake of calcium which will prevent most of the dietary oxalate from being absorbed at all if you also increase your intake of b you shouldn t have to worry about kidney stones at all the rda for b is mg per day for males and mg per day for females directly related to protein intake b can be toxic nerve damage if it is consumed in doses of mg or more per day for an extended peroid weeks to months the usda food survey done in had an average intake of mg per day for males and mg per day for females living in the u s coupled with this low intake was a high protein diet which greatly increases the b requirement as well as the presence of some of the different drugs that either block b absorption are metabolic antagonists of b or promote b excretion in the urine common ones are birth control pills alcohol isoniazid penicillamine and corticosteroids i tell my students to supplement all their patients that are going to get any of the drugs that increase the b requirement the dose recommended for patients taking birth control pills is mg per day and this should work for most of the other drugs that increase the b requirement this would be on top of your dietary intake of b any patient that has a history of kidney stone formation should be given b supplements one other good way to prevent kidney stone formation is to make sure your ca mg dietary ratio is magnesium oxalate is much more soluble than is calcium oxalate the magnesium calcium ratio in the concentrated urines of patients with calcium oxalate calculi invest urol effect of magnesium citrate and magnesium oxide on the crystallization of calcium in urine changes producted by food magnesium interaction j urol review article magnesium in the physiopathology and treatment of renal calcium stones j presse med there are actually about three times as many articles published in the medical literature on the role of magnesium in preventing kidney stone formation than there are for b i thought that i was being pretty safe in stating that magnesium would prevent kidney stone formation in an earlier post in this news group but good old john a in mass jumped all

fathered both religions now islam has turned against its father i may say it is ironic that after communizem threat is almost gone religion wars are going to be on the raise i thought the idea of believing on one god was to unite all man kind how come both jews and islam which believe on the same god the god of ebrahim are killing each other is this like dr frankenstien s story how are you going to stop this from happening how are you going to deal with so many muslims nuking them would distroy the whole world would god get mad since you have killed his followers you believe on the same god same heaven and the same hell after all what is the peacefull way of ending this saga judaism did not father islam we had many of the same prophets but judaism ignores prophets later prophets including jesus christ who christians and muslims believe in and mohammed the idea of believing in one god should unite all peoples however note that christianity and islam reflect the fact that there are people with different views and the rights of non christians and non muslims are stated in each religion man kind needs religion since it sets up the rules and the regulations which keeps the society in a healthy state a religion is mostly a sets of rules which people have experienced and know it works for the society the praying keeps the sole healthy and meditates it god does not care for man kinds pray but man kind hopes that god will help him when he prays religion works mostly on the moral issues and trys to put away the materialistic things in the life but the religious leaders need to make a living through religion so they may corrupt it or turn it to their own way to make their living i e muslims have to pay percent of their income to the mullahs i guess the rabie gets his cut too we are supposed to pay of our income after all necessities are paid please note that this is on a personal basis if you are poor there is no need to pay quite the contrary this money most often goes to the poor in each in country and to the poor muslims around the world also this money is not required in the human sense i e a muslim never knocks at your door to ask for money and nobody makes a list at the mosque to make sure you have paid and we surely don t pass money baskets around during our prayer services is in it that religion should be such that everybody on planet earth respects each other be good toward each other helps one another respect the mother nature is in that heaven and hell are created on earth through the acts that we take today is in it that within every man there is good and bad he could choose either one then he will see the outcome of his choice how can we prevent man kind from going crazy over religion how can we stop another religious killing field under poor gods name what are your thoughts do you think man kind would to come its senses before it is too late p s on the side do you think that moses saw the god on mount sina why would god go to top of the mountain he created the earth he could have been anywhere why on top the mountain was it because people thought to see god you have to reach to the skies heavens why god kept coming back to middle east was it because they created god through their imagination is that why jewish people were told by god they were the chosen ones god s presence is certainly on earth but since god is everywhere god may show signs of existence in other places as well we can not say for sure where god has shown signs of his existence and where he has not profit mohammad was married to khadijeh she was a jewish she taught him how to trade she probably taught him about judaism quran is mostly copy right of taurah sp old testement do you think god wrote quran makeh was a trade city before islam do you think it was made to be the center of islamic world because mohammad wanted to expand his trade business is that why god has put his house in there the qur an is not a copyright of the taurah muslims believe that the taurah the bible and the qur an originally contained much the same message thus the many similiarities however the taurah and the bible have been translated into other languages which has changed their meaning over time a translation also reflects some of the personal views of the translator s the qur an still exists in the same language that it was revealed in arabic therefore we know that mankind has not changed its meaning it is truly what was revealed to mohammed at that time there are many scientific facts which were not discovered by traditional scientific methods until much later such as the development of the baby in the mother s womb i think this religious stuff has gone too far all man kind are going to hurt from it if they do not wise up look at david koresh how that turned out i am afraid in the bigger scale the jews and the muslims will have the same ending only god knows for sure how it will turn out i hope it won t but if that happens it was the will of god religion is needed in the sense to keep people in harmony and keep them doing good things rather than plotting each others distruction there is one earth one life and one god let s all man kind be good toward each other god help us all peace please send this mail to me again so i can read the rest of what you said and yes may god help us all steve
4508###talk.politics.mideast###re armenia says it could shoot down turkish planes in article apr kpc com henrik quayle kpc com writes in article mucit apr vein cs rochester edu mucit cs rochester edu bulent murtezaoglu writes henrik country turks and azeris consistantly want to drag armenia into the henrik karabakh conflict with azerbaijan bm gimme a break capital letters or not the above is pure nonsense it bm seems to me that short sighted armenians are escalating the hostilities henrik again armenians in karabakh are simply defending themselves what do henrik want them to do lay down their arms and let azeris walk all over them news reports i ve seen say otherwise both location and motives wise caps don t change facts bm while hoping that turkey will stay out stop and think for a moment bm will you armenia doesn t need anyone to drag her into the conflict it bm is a part of it henrik armenians knew from the begining that turks were fully engaged henrik training azeris militarily to fight against karabakhi armenians so should i at this point break into caps and start talking about defense etc i don t know how fully engaged turkey is was though henrik the karabakhi armenians who have lived in their homeland for henrik years cut off from armenia and given to azeris by stalin are the henrik ones directly involved in the conflict they are defending henrik themselves against azeri aggression bm huh you didn t expect azeri s to be friendly to forces fighting with them bm within their borders henrik well history is sad remember those are relocated azeris into henrik the armenian land of karabakh by the stalin regime so i hear this justifies bloodshed n years after the fact henrik at last i hope that the u s insists that turkey stay out of the henrik karabakh crisis so that the repeat of the cyprus invasion will never henrik occur again bm you re not playing with a full deck are you where would turkey invade henrik it is not up to me to speculate but i am sure turkey would have stepped henrik into armenia if she could why would turkey do that do you not realize that this is a local clash that turkey never wished to see happen turkey has other plans for region like economic revival co operation etc good stuff in other words i d be happy to bicker with armenians over trade barriers and such on usenet rather than who killed whom in what way which i detest doing and wouldn t do bm are you throwing the cyprus buzzword around with s c g in the header bm in hopes that the greek netters will jump the gun henrik absolutely not i am merely trying to emphasize that in many henrik cases history repeats itself even if one buys into your implicit premise the sane thing to do would be to try not to provoke turkey as was done in if there d been a democratic government instead of a bunch of idiots in athens at the time everybody would have stayed home with their families i have no wish to go into the cyprus quarrel but i suspect what i ve said is not only accurate but also palatable to all parties involved bm yes indeed turkey has the military prowess to intervene what she wishes bm she had however is the diplomatic power to stop the hostilities and bring bm the parties to the negotiating table that s hard to do when armenians bm are attacking azeri towns henrik so let me understand in plain words what you are saying turkey henrik wants a peaceful end to this conflict not so what do you think we want war death and destruction henrik i will believe it when i see it no if you allow yourself to believe it you just might see it henrik now as far as attacking what do you do when you see a gun pointing henrik to your head do you sit there and watch or defend yoursef fat chance this kind of childish rhetoric doesn t help anthing henrik do you remember what azeris did to the armenians in baku all the henrik barberian acts especially against mothers and their children i mean henrik burning people alive now some azeri will come out and give a description of similar stuff perpetrated by armenians one should re hash stuff like this often to keep the hatred alive right bm armenian leaders are lacking the statesmanship to recognize the bm futility of armed conflict and convince their nation that a compromise that bm leads to stability is much better than a military faits accomplis that s bm going to cause incessant skirmishes henrik armenians in karabakh want peace and their own republic they are henrik not asking much they simply want to get back what was taken away henrik from them and given to azeris by stalin well they obviously aren t getting anywhere with their current methods of asking not very peaceful i d say bm think of or years down the line both of the newly independent bm countries need to develop economically and neither one is going to wipe bm the other out these people will be neighbors would it not be better bm to keep the bad blood between them minimal henrik don t get me wrong i also want peaceful solution to the henrik conflict but until azeris realize that the armenians in henrik karabakh will defend themselves against aggresion i don t know if you want a solution or just want to exchange slogans peace isn t what s happening right now furthermore what s happening right now isn t condusive to peace you can spend days and nights raving about how right the armenian position is and i m sure there ll be others who d be happy to talk to you by arguing the other side if entrenched positions lead to war and if people want peace than they should sit down and talk about a compromise armenia isn t strong enough to exercise the we think we re right and we have the bombs so we ll do whatever we want so there style of foreign relations yes you can type stalin in caps and give one sided atrocity stories etc but for peace you need to be willing to talk to the other side you personally can choose not to do that of course this being just usenet the people in power shouldn t be so childish bm if you belong to the armenian diaspora keep in mind that what strikes bm your fancy on the map is costing the local armenians dearly in terms of bm their blood and future henrik again you are taking different turns armenia has no intension henrik to grab any land from azerbaijan the armenians in karabakh henrik are simply defending themselves until a solution is set azeri s would disagree with you on this and the maps i ve seen support what they d be saying it doesn t seem likely that a solution will be reached in this manner bm it s easy to be comfortable abroad and propagandize bm craziness to have your feelings about turks tickled the armenians bm in armenia and n k will be there with the same people you seem to hate bm as their neighbors for maybe years more the sooner there s peace in bm the region the better it is for them and everyone else i d push for bm compromise if i were you instead of hitting the caps lock and spreading bm inflammatory half truths henrik it is not up to me to decide the peace initiative i am absolutely henrik for it it didn t look it when i read your posting it would seem to me that if you can spew mis information about a boogey man you can also talk about how one might avoid the nastiness fair henrik but in the meantime if you do not take care of yourself henrik you will be wiped out such as the case in the era of of henrik the armenian massacres you don t realize i can say the same thing about the turkish massacres yes boys and girls let s always talk about how bad and nasty things were let s do that so we re overwhelmed by anger and let s do that so our kids will also be hateful sounds crazy doesn t it don t do it then bm

is not a terrorist camp as you and the israelis like to view the villages they are small communities with kids playing soccer in the streets women preparing lunch men playing cards etc some young men usually aged between to years are members of the lebanese resistance even the inhabitants of the village do not know who these are they are secretive about it but most people often suspect who they are and what they are up to these young men are supported financially by iran most of the time they sneak arms and ammunitions into the occupied zone where they set up booby traps for israeli patrols every time an israeli soldier is killed or injured by these traps israel retalliates by indiscriminately bombing villages of their own choosing often killing only innocent civilians this a tried and true method utilized by guerilla and terrorists groups to conduct operations in the midst of the local populace thus forcing the opposing state to possible harm innocent civilians in their search or in order to avoid the deaths of civilians abandon the search certainly the people who use the population for cover are also to blaim for dragging the innocent civilians into harm s way are you suggesting that when guerillas use the population for cover israel should totally back down so the easiest way to get away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives tell me tim what are these guerillas doing wrong assuming that they are using civilians for cover are they not killing soldiers in their country if the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on israel is it not working why is it further neccessary for israeli guns to pound lebanese villages why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone you see there is more to the shelling of the villages it is called retaliation getting back getting even it doesn t make sense to shell the villages the least it shows is a reckless disregard by the israeli government for the lives of civilians if israel insists that the so called security zone is necessary for the protection of northern israel than it will have to pay the price of its occupation with the blood of its soldiers if israel is interested in peace than it should withdraw from our land what so the whole bit about attacks on israel from neighboring arab states can start all over again while i also hope for this to happen it will only occur when arab states show that they are prepared to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on israel from their soil they have to prove it or provide some guaratees there is no way israel is going to accept their word not with their past attitude of tolerance towards anti israel guerillas in residence if israel is not willing to accept the word of others then imho it has no business wasting others time coming to the peace talks i have written before on this very newsgroup that the only real solution will come as a result of a comprehensive peace settlement whereby israel withdraws to its own borders and peace keeping troops are stationed along the border to insure no one on either side of the border is shelled good lord brad no i am not basil i think basil is a very intelligent person and i respect what he writes basil is a person that i would gladly call a friend he is however not me nor am i lebanese as some seem to suspect this is the only realistic solution it is time for israel to realize that the concept of a buffer zone aimed at protecting its northern cities has failed in fact it has caused much more israeli deaths than the occasional shelling of northern israel would have resulted in perhaps you are aware that to most communities of people there is the feeling that it is better that many of us die fighting against those who attack us than for few to die while we silently accept our fate if however you call on israel to see the sense of suffering fewer casualties i suggest you apply the same to palestinian arab and islamic groups tim you are ignoring the fact that the palestinians in lebanon have been disarmed hezbollah remains the only independent militia hezbollah does not attack israel except at a few times such as when the idf burned up sheikh mosavi his wife and young son of course if israel would withdraw from lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn t make the lebanese so mad as to do that furthermore with hezbollah subsequently disarmed it would not be possible and now the lebanese government has proven that it is capable of controlling and disarming all militias as they did in all other parts of lebanon basil it has not without the support and active involvement of syria lebanon would not have been able to accomplish all that has occurred once syria leaves who is to say that lebanon will be able to retain control if syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for israel tim when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the syrian border not lately eh israel knows very well that the syrians are able to restrain all who would use territory under their control to attack israel while lebanon would be better off with syria and israel out of its borders the presence of syrian troops in lebanon has meant a sharp decrease in attacks on israeli territory not on israeli troops in lebanon however please note the distinction in the past two years tim your view of this entire matter is far too serenely one sided and selectively naive i disagree basil has always seemed to me to be a cool headed person slow to anger certainly more so than i what is most important is that he is an actual witness to things from the other end of the israeli guns if only the israeli government would remember what it was like when the roles were reversed perhaps they would moderate their retaliation brad hernlem hernlem chess ncsu edu

ad until about the s that s about years there many people alive today who were born in a city called konstantinoupolis i know it doesn t make sense but since when is napoleon about sense anyway further striking bigoted and racist attitude of certain greeks still exists in our day most greeks insist even today that the year old capital of the ottoman empire should be called not by its rightful name of istanbul but by its half a millennium old moniker cons whatever everyone knows that new york city was once called new amsterdam but dutch people do not persist on calling it that today the name of stalingrad too is long gone replaced by volgagrad china s peking traded its name for beiging long ago ciudad trujillo of the dominican republic is now santa domingo zimbabve s old colonial capital salisburry became harrare these changes have all been accepted officially by everyone in the world but greeks are still determined on calling the turkish istanbul by the name of cons how can one explain this total intransigence what makes greeks so different from other mortals year old questionable democracy why don t they seem to reconcile with the fact for instance that istanbul changed hands years ago in ad and that this predates the discovery of the new world by years the declaration of u s independence in will come years later shouldn t then half a millennium be considered enough time for cons to be called a turkish city where is the logic in the greek reasoning if there is any how long can one sit on the laurels of an ancient civilization ancient greece does not exist any more than any other civilizations that existed on the soil of anatolia these undereducated wieneramus live with an illusion it is the same mentality which allows them to rationalize that cyprus is a greek island no history book shows that it ever was it belonged to the ottoman turks lock stock and barrel for a period of well over years in fact prior to the turks acquisition of it following bloody naval battles with the venetians in ad the island of cyprus belonged invariably to several nations the assyrians the sumerians the phoenicians the egyptians the ottoman turks of course in that order owned it as their territory but it has never been the possession of the government of greece not even for one day in the history of the world moreover cyprus is located miles from the greek mainland but only miles from turkiye s southern coastline saddam hussein claims that kuwait was once iraqi territory and the greek cypriot government and the terrorist greek governments think that cyprus also was once part of the greek hegemony those arromdians involved in this grandiose hallucination should wake up from their sweet daydreams and confront reality again wishful thinking is unproductive only facts count as for selanik those jews who survived these assaults in southeastern europe fled particularly to salonica whose jewish population increased substantially as a result from in to in more than half the total population though even there increased persecution by local greeks led many jews to flee elsewhere in the ottoman empire particularly to the great port of izmir despite all the pressure from ottomans and foreign jews alike the ritual murders and other assaults by christians on jews went on and on greek efforts to decimate the jewish population of salonica culminated in and following greek conquest of salonica during the first balkan war when many of its jews were either killed or terrorized into leaving though greece was obligated by the post world war i treaties to allow jews and other minorities to use their own languages in education and to practice their religions without hindrance a law was issued in which forbad all inhabitants from working on sunday stimulating a new jewish exodus as it was intended to do between and there was a series of anti semitic riots in salonica with the cambel quarter where most of the remaining jews lived being burned to the ground this was followed by regulations requiring the use of greek and prohibiting hebrew and judea spanish in the jewish schools a start was made also on expropriating the land of the principal jewish cemetery in salonica for use by the new university in order to derive the jews out by killing and driving out large numbers of jews the greeks left a substantial greek majority in the city for the first time and starting salonica jewry on the way to its final decimation by the nazis during the occupation of greece starting in salonica and izmir of course were not the only places of refuge for jewish refugees entering the empire during its last century of existence istanbul edirne and other parts of rumelia and anatolia received thousands more nor were jews the only refugees received and helped by the government of the sultan thousands of muslims accompanied them in flight from similar persecutions wherever balkan christian states gained independence or expanded the russian conquest of the crimea and the caucasus starting in the late eighteenth century and particularly during and after the crimean war combined with the same independence movements in southeastern europe that had caused so much suffering and flight among its jews caused thousands of helpless ill and poverty stricken muslim refugees to accompany them into the ever shrinking boundaries of the ottoman empire with the istanbul government struggling mightly but vainly to house and feed them as best it could from to as many as crimean tatars circassians and other muslims from north and east of

barren town with empty shops and treeless dirt roads yet it was still home to thousands of people who in happier times tended fields and flocks of geese last week it was wiped off the map as sickening reports trickled in to the azerbaijani border town of agdam and the bodies piled up in the morgues there was little doubt that khojaly and the stark foothills and gullies around it had been the site of the most terrible massacre since the soviet union broke apart i was the last westerner to visit khojaly that was in january and people were predicting their fate with grim resignation zumrut ezoya a mother of four on board the helicopter that ferried us into the town called her community sitting ducks ready to get shot she and her family were among the victims of the massacre on february the armenians have taken all the outlying villages one by one and the government does nothing balakisi sakikov a father of five said next they will drive us out or kill us all said dilbar his wife the couple their three sons and three daughters were killed in the assault as were many other people i had spoken to it was close to the armenian lines we knew we would have to cross there was a road and the first units of the column ran across then all hell broke loose bullets were raining down from all sides we had just entered their trap the azeri defenders picked off one by one survivors say that armenian forces then began a pitiless slaughter firing at anything moved in the gullies a video taken by an azeri cameraman wailing and crying as he filmed body after body showed a grizzly trail of death leading towards higher forested ground where the villagers had sought refuge from the armenians the armenians just shot and shot and shot said omar veyselov lying in hospital in agdam with

over shown to journalists afterwards showed dozens of corpses lying in various parts of the hills the azerbaijanis claim that as many as have died in a mass killing of azerbaijanis fleeing from the town of khodjaly seized by armenians last week a further are believed to be wounded frozen to death or missing seven of us squatted in the cabin of an azerbaijani m attack helicopter as we flew to investigate the claims of the mass killings suddenly there was a thump against the underside of the aircraft a red flash of tracer ripped past the starboard wing and the helicopter rocked sharply we swung round and there was a deafening burst of fire from the cannon under our wing as the helicopter crew returned fire we had been fired on from an armenian anti aircraft post we swung round again tipped to starboard and appeared to dive straight down into a valley the brown earth swooped around our heads the helicopter swung round again and followed the contours of the ground our cannon fired repeated blasts later it emerged that a civilian helicopter that we had been escorting had landed successfully at nakhichevanik in the east of the disputed enclave of nagorno karabakh to pick up some of the dead we had in fact been attacked both by ground fire and by an armenian helicopter i had seen the armenian helicopter intermittently through the window its cannons firing but had thought mistakenly that it was on our side our group of western journalists had embarked on a search and rescue flight that had become a combat mission our flight consisted of the civilian passenger helicopter and two m soviet attack helicopters in the azerbaijani service nicknamed flying crocodiles for their armour our party was in the second crocodile the civilian helicopter s job was to land in the mountains and pick up bodies at sites of the mass killings the attack helicopters were there to give covering fire if necessary the operation showed a striking sign of the disintegration of the soviet armed forces because our pilot was a russian officer an azerbaijani official told us that there were now five former soviet military helicopters and their pilots fighting for azerbaijan they have signed contracts to fly for us he said the helicopter we engaged in combat was most probably flown by a brother officer of our russian pilot but fighting for the armenians we had taken off just

district were injured how were they injured they were beaten even women it was said that they were at the demonstrations but they live here and went from here to karabagh to demonstrate after that i felt uneasy there were some conversations about armenians among the local population the armenians had done this the armenians had done that right there at the site i was attacked a couple of times by kids well true the guys from my crew wouldn t let them come at me with cables and knives after that i felt really bad i didn t know where to go i up and called home and my children tell me there s unrest everywhere be careful well i had a project going on i told the second secretary of the district party committee what had been going on and said i wanted to take my crew off the site they wouldn t allow it they said nothing s going to happen to you we ve entrusted the matter to the police we ve warned everyone in the district nothing will happen to you well in fact they did especially detail us a policeman to look after me he knows all the local people and would protect me if something happened this man didn t leave me alone for five minutes he was at work the whole time and afterward he spent the night with us too i sense some disquiet and call home my wife also tells me the situation is very tense be careful we finished the job at the site and i left for sumgait first thing on the morning of the th when we left the guys warned me they told me that i shouldn t tell anyone on the way that i was an armenian i took someone else s business travel documents in the name of zardali and hid my own i hid it and my passport in my socks we set out for baku our guys were on the bus they sat behind and i sat up front in baku they had come to me and said that they had to collect all of our travel documents just in case as it turns out they knew what was happening in sumgait i arrive at the bus station and there they tell me that the city of sumgait is closed there is no way to get there that the city is closed off and the buses aren t running buses normally leave baku for sumgait almost every two minutes and suddenly no buses well we tried to get there via private drivers one man an azerbaijani said let s go find some other way to get there they found a light transport vehicle and arranged for the driver to take us to sumgait he took us there but the others had said i wouldn t go if you gave me a thousand rubles why because they re burning the city and killing the armenians there isn t an armenian left well i got hold of myself so i could still stand up so we squared it away the four of us got in the car and we set off for sumgait on the way the driver says in fact there aren t any armenians left they burned them all beat them all and stabbed them well i was silent the whole way odd miles i was silent the driver asks me how old are you old man he wants to know if i m being that quiet not saying anything maybe it means i m an armenian how old are you he asks me i say i m i m too but i call you old man i say it depends on god each person s life in this world is different i look much older than my years that s why he called me old man well after that he was silent too we re approaching the city i look and see tanks all around and a cordon before we get to the kavkaz store the driver starts to wave his hand well he was waving his hand we all start waving our hands i m sitting there with them i start waving my hand too i realized that this was a sign that meant there were no armenians with us i look at the city there is a crowd of people walking down the middle of the street you know and there s no traffic well probably i was scared they stopped our car people were standing on the sidewalks they have armature shafts and stones and they stopped us along the way the driver tells us how they know who s an armenian and who s not the armenians usually for example i m an armenian but i speak their language very well well armenians usually pronounce the azeri word for nut or little nut as pundukh but fundukh is actually correct the pronunciations are different anyone who says pundukh even if they re not armenian they immediately take out and start to slash another one says there was a car there with five people inside it he says they started hitting the side of it with an axe and lit it on fire and they didn t let the people out he says they wouldn t let them get out of the car i only saw the car but the driver says that he saw everything well he often drives from baku to sumgait and back when they stop us we all get out of the car i look and there s a short guy his eyes are gleaming he has an armature shaft in one hand and a stone in the other and asks the guys what nationality they are one by one we re azerbaijani they tell him no armenians here he did come up to me when we were pulling our things out and says maybe you re an armenian old man but in azerbaijani i say you should be ashamed of yourself and he left turned and left that was all that happened what was i to do i had to the city was on fire but i had to steal my children out of my own home they stopped us at the entrance to mir street that s where the kavkaz store and three large story buildings are that s the beginning of down town i saw that burned automobile there completely burned only metal remained i couldn t figure out if it was a zhiguli or a zaporozhets later i was told it was a zhiguli and the people in there were completely incinerated nothing remained of them not even any traces that driver had told me about it and i saw the car myself the car was there the skeleton a metallic carcass about to yards from the kavkaz store i see a military transport an armored personnel carrier the hatches are closed and people are throwing armature shafts and pieces of iron at it the crowd is and i hear shots not automatic fire it s true but pistol shots several shots there were azerbaijanis crowded around that personnel carrier someone in the crowd was shooting apparently they either wanted to kill the soldiers or get a machine gun or something at that point there was only one armored personnel carrier and all the tanks were outside the city cordoning off sumgait i walked on i see two azerbaijanis going home from the plant i can tell by their gait that they re not bandits they re just people walking home i joined them so in case something happened in case someone came up to us and asked questions either of us would be in a position to answer you see but i avoided the large groups because i m a local and might be quickly recognized i tried to keep at a distance and walked where there were fewer people well so i walked into microdistrict which is across from our block i can t get into our block but i walked where there were fewer people so as to get around well there i see a tall guy and to people are walking behind him and he s shouting into a megaphone comrades the armenian azerbaijani war has begun the police have megaphones like that so they re talking and walking around the second microdistrict i see that they re coming my way and turn off behind a building i noticed that they walked around the outside buildings and inside the microdistricts there were about or people standing on every corner and at the middles of the buildings and at the edges what they were doing i can t say because i couldn t get up close to them i was afraid but the most important thing was to get away from there to get home and at least find out if my children were alive or not april yerevan reference the sumgait tragedy

they gave us a private room an isolation room we stayed in the hospital until the th some police car came and they said emma let s go and the women our colleagues then they saw the police car became anxious and said where are you taking her i say they re going to kill me too and the investigator says why are you saying that we re going to make a positive identification we went to baku and they took me into the morgue i still can t remember what hospital it was the investigator says let s go we need to be certain maybe it s not shagen and when i saw the caskets lying on top of one another i went out of my mind i say i can t look no the investigator says are there any identifying marks i say let me see the clothes or the shoes or even a sock i ll recognize them he says isn t they re anything on his body i say he has seven gold teeth and his finger he only has half of one of his fingers shagen was a carpenter he had been injured at work they brought one of the sleeves of the shirt and sweater he was wearing they brought them and they were all burned when i saw them i shouted oh they burned him i shouted i don t know i fell down or maybe i sat down i don t remember and that investigator says well fine fine since we ve identified that these are his clothes and since his teeth since he has seven gold teeth on the th they told me emma it s time to bury shagen now i cried how how can i bury shagen when i have only one son and he s sick i should inform his relatives he has three sisters i can t do it by myself they say ok you know the situation how will they get here from karabagh how will they get here from yerevan there s no transportation it s impossible he was killed on february and i buried him on march we buried him in sumgait they asked me where do you want to bury him i said i want to bury him in karabagh where we were born let me bury him in karabagh i m shouting and the head of the burial office i guess says do you know what it means take him to karabagh it means arson i say what do you mean arson don t they know what s going on in karabagh the whole world knows that they killed them and i want to take him to karabagh i don t have anyone anymore i begged i pleaded i grieved i even got down on my knees he says let s bury him here now and in three months in six months a year if it calms down i ll help you move him to karabagh our trial was the first in sumgait it was concluded on may at the investigation the murderer tale ismailov told how it all happened but then at the trial he tried to wriggle he tried to soften his crime then they brought a videotape recorder i guess and played it and said ismailov look is that you he says yes well look here you re describing everything as it was on the scene of the crime right he says yes and now you re telling it differently he says well maybe i forgot like that the witnesses and that criminal creep himself said that when the car was going along mir street there was a crowd of about people shagen had a volga gaz the people surrounded his car and all of them were involved one of them was this ismailov guy this tale they it s unclear who started pulling shagen out of the car well one says from the left side of the car another says from the right side they pulled off his sports jacket he had a jacket on well they ask him what s your nationality he says armenian well they say from the crowd they shouted if he s an armenian kill him kill him they started beating him they broke seven of his ribs and his heart i don t know they did something there too it s too awful to tell about anyway they say this tale guy he had an armature shaft he says i picked it up it was lying near a bush that s where i got it he said he picked it up but the witnesses say that he had already had it he said i hit him twice he said once or twice on the head with that rod and he said that when he started to beat him shagen was sitting on the ground and when he hit him he fell over he said i left right nearby they were burning things or something in an apartment killing someone he says and i came back to look is that shagen alive or not i said you wanted to finish him right and if he was still alive you came back to hit him again he went back and looked and he was already dead after that that bastard tale said after that i went home i said you you little snake i said are you a thief and a murderer shagen had had money in his jacket and a watch on his wrist they were taken he says he didn t take them when they overturned and burned the car that tale was no longer there it was other people who did that who it was who turned over the car and who burned it that hasn t been clarified as yet i told the investigator how can you have the trial when you don t know who burned the car he said something but i didn t get what he was saying but i said you still haven t straightened everything out i think that s unjust when they burned the car he was lying next to it and the fire spread to him in the death certificate it says that he had third degree burns over percent of his body and i ask again why was he killed my husband was a carpenter he was a good craftsman he knew how to do everything he even fixed his own car with his own hands we have three children three sons only igor was with me at the time the older one was in pyatigorsk and the younger one is serving in the army and now they re fatherless i couldn t sit all the way through it when the procurator read up to years deprivation of freedom i just i went out of my mind i didn t know what to do with myself i said how can that be you i said you are saying that it was intentional murder and the sentence is years deprivation of freedom i screamed i had my mind i said let me at that creep with my bare hands i ll a relative restrained me and there were all those military people there i lest i said this isn t a soviet trial this is unjust that s what i shouted l said it and left i said that on february when those people were streaming down our street they were shouting long live turkey and glory to turkey and during the trial i said to that ismailov what does that mean glory to turkey i still don t understand what turkey has to do with this we live in the soviet union that turkey told you to or is going to help you kill armenians i still don t understand why glory to turkey i asked that question twice and

karabakh right we should slaughter the armenians and there s no need to be afraid all of moscow is behind us i even heard that all moscow is behind us well i watched and listened in and realized that this was no joke deposition of yuri vagarshakovich musaelian born line electrician sumgait streetcar and trolleybus administration resident at building apartment block narimanov street sumgait azerbaijan i spent almost all of february doing overhaul the th was a short day at work we worked until eleven or eleven thirty and left for home i decided to go for a short walk i went to primorsky park i walked past the eternal flame and saw a group of about to people standing there when i had walked another to yards i heard the screech of automobile brakes behind me i turned my head toward the sound it was a light blue gaz volga i see that the people who were standing there have gone over to the car a man and a woman get out the man is expensively dressed in a suit and the woman has a raincoat on she doesn t have anything on her head and her hair is let down sightly reddish hair a heavy set woman they re to years old they get something out of the trunk the people start to help them i become curious just what are they pulling out of there when i got up close i heard them turn something on i didn t see what it was but it was probably a tape recorder they put it on the ground near the eternal flame honoring the baku commissars and formed a tight circle around it i ask what s going on someone tells me come listen well they were azerbaijanis i had asked in azerbaijani i hear appeals brother muslims our time has come and something else along that line i didn t understand what it was all about i walked around the group trying to get a look at the owner of the tape recorder but the circle drew in tighter new people started coming from various directions five here seven there and the comments started right we should slaughter the armenians and there s no need to be afraid all of moscow is behind us i even heard that all moscow is behind us well i watched and listened in and realized that this was no joke i quietly left and went home now before that at work i had heard that something was going on in karabagh that there were demonstrations there well people were saying all kinds of things but i didn t have any idea what was really going on my wife and son were at home but my daughter was at my aunt s house in baku i didn t say anything to my wife we sat and drank tea sometime around two o clock right behind our house suddenly there is noise whistling and shouting i looked out the window and saw a crowd the crowd is moving slowly like they show on tv when blacks in south africa are striking or having a demonstration and move slowly my wife asks what s going on out there i say i don t know i put on some outdoor clothes and went out to find out what it was all about in the crowd people are shouting down with the armenians and death to the armenians i waited for the entire crowd to pass at first they went down narimanov street on the side with the sk club and the city party committee then they turned and went against the traffic it s one way there down the street of the baku commissars toward the streetcar line i went home and told my wife there was a demonstration going on in fact i thought that we were having the same kind of demonstrations that they had had in yerevan and in karabagh aside from the things they were shouting i was surprised that there were only young people in the crowd and they were minors under draft age my wife and son wanted to go upstairs to visit a friend but i was kind of uneasy and said no let s stay at home instead an hour went by or maybe an hour and a half well i wasn t keeping track of the time i can t say exactly how long it was i look and see another crowd on narimanov but now on the side with the microdistricts the bazaar and the rossiya movie theater i put outside clothes on and went out again there s noise an uproar outside and the crowd has grown there are more people and whereas the first time there were individual shouts this time they are more focused more aggressive no i think something s wrong here this isn t any demonstration they would run stop then walk quickly and make sharp dashes and then run again i was walking along the sidewalk and they were in the street i followed them i was thinking i d just watch and see who knew where this was leading we came out on lenin square at the square the sk club is on one side and the city party committee is on the other i went toward the square and heard noise and shouting as though the whole town had turned out there was some sort of a rally going on i go closer and hear exclamations appeals i heard both anti armenian and anti soviet appeals we don t need perestroika we want to go on living like we have been now what did they mean by living like we have been the azerbaijanis work like everyone else but too many people live at the expense of the government and at the expense of others speculation theft and cheating go on all the time and not just in azerbaijan everywhere in all the republics but i ve never seen it anywhere else like i have in azerbaijan now at this rally someone says that they should go around to the armenians apartments and drive them out beat them and drive them out true i didn t hear them say kill them over the microphone i only heard beat them and drive them out i stayed at the square a few minutes longer first one then another are going up onto the stage and no one tries to stop the crowd off to the side of the crowd there were small groups of three or four people and i think they were mvd ministry of internal affairs or state security kgb there were also uniformed policemen there but i didn t see any of them try to pacify the crowd new people kept coming up onto the stage well i had finally decided that this could end badly this was no demonstration and i had to protect my family i left the square to return home and suddenly noticed a truck it was next to the city party committee on narimanov street it stood next to the tai lor s shop there a low truck and it had low wooden panels i see that some thing is being unloaded crates of some sort i decided to go look because after all those appeals i was apprehensive and thought there might be weapons in there they pulled the crates out onto the square not toward the city party committee but toward the sk club and when i went right up to them i saw that they were cases of vodka there were two people handing down the cases from the bed of the truck and on the ground there were many people to they were handing them down from the truck and each case was carried off by two people two people one case of vodka and there was a man standing right next to the truck and he was handing out roundish black lumps maybe about the size of a fist maybe a little bigger or smaller it was anasha when i passed next to that person he stood with his side to me there was about a yard and a half between us and two people were standing near him he has a package in his hand and he s pulling out anasha and handing it out i have never smoked it myself once i tried it for fun but i ve seen a lot of people smoke it i ve seen it many times and i know what it is i strolled around and no one asked me who i was or what i was doing there before i got to the glass bazaar i heard more howling more warlike shouting i turned around and saw them running well i ll just keep on going like i am i thought when they caught up with me i saw that they were carrying flags and i recognized the person who was carrying the flag on my side of the street he s a young guy or years old he was carrying a red flag which had ermeni oryum written on it in azerbaijani that means death to armenians that guy used to live off the same courtyard as us i don t really know what his name is but i know his father very well his father s name is rafik he used to be a cook and then became head chef he used to have a dark blue zhiguli van then he sold it and now he has a white zhiguli his family as i said lived on the same courtyard as we did our building was on narimanov street and theirs was on the street of the baku commissars their apartment was in the far entryway on the fifth floor the door on the left now rafik s little brother lives there and he rafik i heard got a new apartment either in the forth or eighth microdistrict in a word his son was carrying a flag that said death to armenians i was surprised because before this i had gotten the impression that all of this nonsense was being done not by people from sumgait but by azerbaijanis from agdam and kafan well anyway i went home my wife was upset i told her it s ok it ll pass they re young kids they ve just gotten all whooped up naturally i didn t want her to get overly upset after a while a new surge of crowd went by and this time they were breaking glass i could hear it breaking but i couldn t see where well i think here we go the machine s in motion they weren t handing out that vodka and anasha for nothing i didn t see people drinking and smoking on the spot but they certainly hadn t unloaded the vodka and hashish to put in a store window so the thought flashed through my head that the machine was running no one would stop them now they weren t even trying although i ll say it again the police were there i saw them and it s not just that the police weren t breaking them up they were joking with them they were having a good time true at the time i couldn t even imagine that under our government our much vaunted leadership and i m not afraid to say these words so many people died so many women were abused and how many abominations there were i couldn t imagine that under our much vaunted authorities and if i were to be specific i would say under the much touted authorities in our city of sumgait i couldn t imagine that such things could take place when they started breaking glass i told my wife and son let s go upstairs we went to our neighbors the grigorians on the fourth floor and in the evening when those crowds started going past again i went outside once more i stopped at the corner a place called that right next to the bazaar i look and see a crowd on the run and there a few yards from the entrance to the bazaar are three respectable looking men of around say years old the crowd was running and one of the three waved with his arm and pointed toward the bazaar and then the whole crowd as though it were one person wheeled and raced toward the bazaar and not a soul went past those three as though it were off limits well everything got all churned up there was more noise and the glass was flying again we spent the night at the neighbors my apartment was on the first floor there was really no way to defend yourself there in the morning i went out to buy bread and to see what was happening in town on the way i saw someone hunched up still i never found out who it was or what happened to him there were to people standing near him i got the bread and on my way back they had gathered around the person who was lying there hunched up sort of enclosing him because of the way they were standing you couldn t even see him that was on the morning of february everyone knows the rest may yerevan reference the

4581###talk.politics.mideast###symbiotics zionism antisemitism from center for policy research cpr subject symbiotics zionism antisemitism zionism and the holocaust by haim bresheeth the first point to note regarding the appropriation of the history of the holocaust by zionist propaganda is that zionism without anti semitism is impossible zionism agrees with the basic tenet of anti semitism namely that jews cannot live with non jews the history and roots of the holocaust go back a long way while the industru of death and destruction did not operate before its roots were firmly placed in the th century jewish aspirations for emancipation emerged out of the national struggles in europe when the hopes for liberation through bourgeois democratic change were dashed other alternatives for improving the lot of the jews of europe achieved prominence the socialist bund a mass movement with enormous following had to contend with opposition from a new and small almost insignificant opponent the political zionists in outline these two offered diametrically opposed options for jews in europe while the bund was suggesting joining forces with the rest of europe s workers the zionists were proposing a new programme aimed at ridding europe of its jews by setting up some form of a jewish state historically nothing is inevitable all depends on the balance of forces involved in the struggle history can be seen as an option tree every time a certain option is chosen other routes become barred because of that choice movement backwards to the point before that choice was made is impossible while zionism as an option was taken by many young jews it remained a minority position until the first days of the rd reich the zionist federation of germany zvfd an organisation representing a tiny minority of german jews was selected by the nazis as the body to represent the jews of the reich its was the only flag of an interantional organisation allowed to fly in berlin and this was the only international organisation allowed to operate during this period from a marginal position the leaders of the zionist federation were propelled to a prominence and centrality that surprised even them all of a sudden they attained political power power based not on representation but from being selected as the choice of the nazi regime for dealing with the the jewish problem their position in negotiating with the nazis agreements that affected the lives of many tens of thousands of the jews in germany transformed them from a utopian marginal organisation in germany and some other countries in europe into a real option to be considered by german jews the best example of this was the transfer agreement of immediately after the nazi takeover in jews all over the world supported or were organising a world wide boycott of german goods this campaign hurt the nazi regime and the german authorities searched frantically for a way disabling the boycott it was clear that if jews and jewish organisations were to pull out the campaign would collapse this problem was solved by the zvfd a letter sent to the nazi party as early as june outlined the degree of agreement that existed between the two organisations on the question of race nation and the nature of the jewish problem and it offered to collaborate with the new regime the realisation of zionism could only be hurt by resentment of jews abroad against the german development boycott propaganda such as is currently being carried out against germany in many ways is in essence unzionist because zionism wants not to do battle but to convince and build in their eagerness to gain credence and the backing of the new regime the zionist organisation managed to undermine the boycott the main public act was the signature of the transfer agreement with the nazi authorities during the zionist congress of in essence the agreement was designed to get germany s jews out of the country and into mandate palestine it provided a possibility for jews to take a sizeable part of their property out of the country through a transfer of german goods to palestine this right was denied to jews leaving to any other destination the zionist organisation was the acting agent through its financial organisations this agreement operated on a number of fronts helping jews to leave the country breaking the ring of the boycott exporting german goods in large quantities to palestine and last but not least enabling the regime to be seen as humane and reasonable even towards its avowed enemies the jews after all they argued the jews do not belong in europe and now the jews come and agree with them after news of the agreement broke the boycott was doomed if the zionist organization found it possible and necessary to deal with the nazis and import their goods who could argue for a boycott this was not the first time that the interests of both movements were presented to the german public as complementary baron von mildenstein the first head of the jewish department of the ss later followed by eichmann was invited to travel to palestine this he did in early in the company of a zionist leader kurt tuchler having spent six months in palestine he wrote a series of favourable articles in der sturmer describing the new jew of zionism a jew nazis could accept and understand this little known episode established quite clearly the relationship during the early days of nazism between the new regime and the zvfd a relationship that was echoed later in a number of key instances even after the nature of the final solution became clear in many cases this meant a silencing of reports about the horrors of the exterminations a book concentrating on this aspect of the zionist reaction to the holocaust is post ugandan zionism in the crucible of the holocaust by s b beth zvi in the case of the kastner episode around which jim allen s play perdition is based even the normal excuse of lack of knowledge of the real nature of events does not exist it occured near the end of the war the ussr had advanced almost up to germany italy and the african bases had been lost the nazis were on the run with a number of key countries such as rumania leaving the axis a second front was a matter of months away as the western allies prepared their forces in the midst of all this we find eichmann the master bureaucrat of industrial murder setting up his hz in occupied budapest after the german takeover of the country in april his first act was to have a conference with the jewish leadership and to appoint zionist federation members headed by kastner as the agent and clearing house for all jews and their relationship with the ss and the nazr authorities why they did this is not difficult to see as opposed to poland where its three and a half million jews lived in ghettoes and were visibly different from the rest of the polish population the hungarian jews were an integrated part of the community the middle class was mainly jewish the jews were mainly middle class they enjoyed freedom of travel served in the hungarian fascist army in fronline units as officers and soldiers their names were hungarian how was eichmann to find them if they were to be exterminated the task was not easy there were a million jews in hungary most of them resident the rest being refugees from other countries many had heard about the fate of jews elsewhere and were unlikely to believe any statements by nazi officials like elsewhere the only people who had the information and the ear of the frightened jewish population were the judenrat in this case the judenrat comprsied mainly the zionist federation members without their help the ss with officers and less than men plus a few hundred hungarian police could not have collected and controlled a million jews when they did not even know their whereabouts kastner and the others were left under no illusions eichmann told joel brand one of the members of kastner s committee that he intended to send all hungary s jews to auschwitz before he even started the expulsions he told them clearly that all these jews will die a day unless certain conditions were met the committee faced a simple choice to tell the jews of hungary about their fate with neutral rumania where many could escape being in most cases a few hours away or to collaborate with the nazis by assisting in the concentration process what would not have been believed when coming from the ss sounded quite plausible when coming from the mouths of the zionist leadership thus it is that most of the hungarian jews went quietly to their death assured by their leadership that they were to be sent to work camps to be sure there are thirty pieces of silver in this narrative of destruction the trains of prominents which eichmann promised to kastner a promise he kept to the last detail for eichmann it was a bargain allowing jews to survive as the price paid for the silent collaboration over the death of almost a million jews there was no way in which the jews of hungary could even be located not to say murdered without the full collaboration of kastner and his few friends no doubt the ss would hunt a few jews here and there but the scale of the operation would have been miniscule compared to the half million who died in auschwitz it is important to realise that kastner was not an aberration like say rumkovsky in lodz kastner acted as a result of his strongly held zionist convictions his actions were a logical outcome of earlier positions this is instanced when he exposed to the gestapo the existence of a british cell of saboteurs palgi and senesh and persuaded them to give themselves up so as not to disrupt his operations at no point during his trial or elsewhere did kastner deny that he knew exactly what was to happen to those jews to conclude the role played by zionists in this period was connected to another role they could and should have played that of alarming the whole world to what was happening in europe they had the information but politically it was contrary to their priorities the priorities were and still are quite simple all that furthers the zionist enterprise in palestine is followed whatever the price the lives of individuals jews and non jews are secondary if this process requires dealing with fascists nazis and other assorted dictatorial regimes across the world so be it

4583###talk.politics.mideast###more on adl spying case los angeles times tuesday april p a new details of extensive adl spy operation emerge inquiry transcripts reveal nearly years of espionage by a man who infiltrated political groups by richard c paddock times staff writer san francisco to the outside world roy bullock was a small time art dealer who operated from his house in the castro district in reality he was an undercover spy who picked through garbage and amassed secret files for the anti defamation league for nearly years his code name at the prominent jewish organization was cal and he was so successful at infiltrating political groups that he was once chosen to head an arab american delegation that visited rep nancy pelosi d san francisco in her washington d c office for a time cal tapped into the phone message system of the white aryan resistance to learn of hate crimes from police sources he obtained privileged personal information on at least people and he met surreptitiously with agents of the south african government to trade his knowledge for crisp new bills these are among the secrets that bullock and david gurvitz a former los angeles based operative divulged in extensive interviews with police and the fbi in a growing scandal over the nation wide intelligence network operated by the anti defamation league officials of the anti defamation league while denying any improper activity have said they will cooperate with the investigation they have refused to discuss bullock and gurvitz transcripts of the interviews among nearly pages of documents released by san francisco prosecutors last week offer new details of the private spy operation that authorities allege crossed the line into illegal territory at times the intelligence activities took on a cloak and dagger air with laundered payments shredded documents hotel rendezvous with foreign agents and code names like ironsides and flipper on one occasion gurvitz recounts he received a tip that a pro palestinian activist was about to board a plane bound for haifa israel although the anti defamation league publicly denies any ties to israel gurvitz phoned an israeli consular official to warn him shortly afterward another official called gurvitz back and debriefed him the court papers also added to the mystery of tom gerard a former cia agent and san francisco police officer accused of providing confidential material from police files to the anti defamation league gerard fled to the philippines last fall after he was interviewed by the fbi but left behind a briefcase in his police locker its contents included passports driver s licenses and identification cards in different names identification cards in his own name for four american embassies in central america and a collection of blank birth certificates army discharge papers and official stationery from various agencies also in the briefcase were extensive information on death squads a black hood apparently for use in interrogations and photos of blindfolded and chained men investigators suspect that gerard and other police sources gave the adl confidential driver s license or vehicle registration information on a vast number of people including as many as members of one target group the arab american anti discrimination committee each case of obtaining such data from a law enforcement officer would constitute a felony san francisco police inspector ron roth noted in an affidavit for a search warrant the anti defamation league a self described jewish defense and civil rights organization acknowledges it has long collected information on groups that are anti semitic extremist or racist the adl s fact finding division headed by irwinn suall in new york enjoys a reputation for thoroughness and has often shared its information with police agencies and journalists however evidence seized from bullock s computer shows he kept files on at least groups of all political stripes including the american civil liberties union earth island institute the united farm workers jews for jesus mother jones magazine the center for investigative reporting the bo gritz for president committee the asian law caucus and the aids activist group act up the computer files also included information on several members of congress including pelosi house armed services committee chairman ron dellums d berkeley and former republican rep pete mccloskey from the bay area in their statements bullock and gurvitz said the anti defamation league has collected information on political activists in the los angeles area for more than years they said they worked closely with three los angeles county sheriff s deputies who specialized in intelligence work a los angeles police department anti terrorism expert and a san diego county sheriff s department intelligence officer a spokesman for the los angeles sheriff s department said he knew nothing of any contact between the deputies and the adl the los angeles police department which earlier refused to cooperate with the investigation and the san diego sheriff s department declined comment bullock is one of the most intriguing characters in the spy drama although he is not jewish he began working undercover as a volunteer for the adl and the fbi in indiana in after reading a book about a man who infiltrated the communist party bullock moved to los angeles in and was given a paid position by the adl as an intelligence operative he told authorities in the mid s he moved to san francisco and continued his spy operations up and down the west coast to keep his identity secret his salary has always been funneled through beverly hills attorney bruce i hochman who has never missed a payment in more than years bullock said i was an investigator for the adl i investigated any and all anti democratic movements bullock said officially i m only a contract worker with bruce hochman that way the league would not be officially connected with me bullock said he became a master at infiltrating groups from communists to arab american to gay radicals to skinheads usually using his own name but once adopting the alias elmer fink i m one of a kind he told police in recent years however his adl affiliation has increasingly become known and at one point he was confronted by a skinhead armed with a shotgun who threatened to kill him in the mid s he helped san francisco police solve a bombing at a synagogue by combing through the trash of extremist cory phelps and matching handwriting with samples on a threatening letter obtained by police in part because of this investigation he became close friends with gerard who at the time was working in the san francisco police intelligence division bullock frequently searched through the garbage of target groups an fbi report noted how he investigated one palestinian group bullock would write reports based on what he found in the trash and would share the reports with gerard bullock also gave the trash to gerard for gerard to examine gerard would later return the trash to bullock from a wide range of sources bullock compiled files on individuals and more than political groups gerard whose files contained many identical entries kept files on people in bullock and gerard began selling some of their vast wealth of information to the south african government bullock tells of meetings secretly with south african agents at san francisco hotels and receiving envelopes filled with thousands of dollars in new bills bullock insists the information he sold consisted of data he culled only from public sources once he rewrote an innocuous item published by san francisco chronicle columnist herb caen about south african bishop desmond tutu and the wife of prominent attorney melvin belli and submitted it as his own work bullock said it was gerard who sold official police intelligence bullock said he split about from the south african government evenly with gerard telling him at one point i may be gay but i m a straight arrow in his interviews with the police and fbi bullock talked freely about engaging in certain activities that prosecutors say would appear to violate the law for example bullock admitted to receiving driver s license records and criminal histories from gerard on about people a fraction of the confidential police data found in his computer and he said gerard gave him complete san francisco police department intelligence files on various nazi groups that were supposed to be destroyed under department policy bullock said he also received a confidential fbi report on the nation of islam that he later shredded at the anti defamation league s san francisco office bullock seemed proud of his operation eavesdrop in which he used a paid informant code named scumbag to help tap into a white aryan resistance phone message network listening to the messages left by members of the right wing group for a short time it was wonderful he told police in los angeles adl operative gurvitz was hired about four years ago as a fact finder to keep intelligence files and occasionally go undercover to the meetings of target groups among other things he told san francisco authorities the los angeles adl office kept a record of any arab american who had anti israel leanings or who wrote a letter to a newspaper expressing such sentiment gurvitz was recently forced to resign after an incident in which he attempted to misuse the adl intelligence network to seek revenge on a rival who got a job gurvitz wanted at the simon wiesenthal center for holocaust studies gurvitz got confidential police data on the rival and threatened to expose him as a jewish spy to a right wing hate group gurvitz has since begun cooperating with police and the fbi in the probe providing considerable information about the adl operation unlike bullock he has been assured he is not a subject of the investigation

4603###talk.politics.mideast###re ten questions about israel in article apr vms huji ac il backon vms huji ac il writes in article igc apc org cpr igc apc org center for policy research writes is it true that in israeli prisons there are a number of individuals which were tried in secret and for which their identities the date of their trial and their imprisonment are state secrets apart from mordechai vanunu who had a trial behind closed doors there was one other espionage case the nutty professor at the nes ziona biological institute who was a k g b mole who was tried in camera i wouldn t exactly call it a state secret the trial was simply tried behind closed doors i hate to disappoint you but the united states has tried a number of espionage cases in camera at issue was not a trial behind closed doors but arrest trial and imprisonment in complete secrecy this was appraently attempted in the case of vanunu and failed it has happened before and there is reason to believe it still goes on read this from ma ariv february possibly publication ban the state of israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public by baruch me iri all those involved in this matter politely refused my request one way or another look the subject is too delicate if i comment on it i will be implicitly admitting that it is true if i mention a specific case even hint at it i might be guilty of making public something which may legally not be published the state of israel has never officially admitted that for many years there have been in its prisons israeli citizens who were sentenced to long prison terms without either the fact of their arrest or the crimes of which they were accused ever being made public more precisely a court ordered publication ban was placed on the fact of their arrest and later on their imprisonment in israel of citizens are imprisoned without us the citizens of this country knowing anything about it not knowing anything about the fact that one person or another were tried and thrown in prison for security offenses in complete secrecy in the distant past for example during the days of the lavon ya affair we heard about the third man being in prison but many years have passed since then and what existed then can today no longer be found even in south american countries or in the former communist countries but it appears that this is still possible in israel of the chair of the knesset committee on law the constitution and justice mk david zucker sent a letter on this subject early this week to the prime minister the minister of justice and the cabinet legal advisor ma ariv has obtained the content of the letter during the past several years a number of israeli citizens have been imprisoned for various periods for security offenses in some of these cases a legal publication ban was imposed not only on the specifics of the crimes for which the prisoners were convicted but even on the mere fact of their imprisonment in those cases after being legally convicted the prisoners spend their term in prison without public awareness either of the imprisonment or of the prisoner asserts mk zucker on the other hand zucker agrees in his letter that there is absolutely no question that it is possible and in some cases it is imperative that a publication ban be imposed on the specifics of security offenses and the course of trials but even in such cases the court must weigh carefully and deliberately the circumstances under which a trial will not be held in public however one must ask whether the imposition of a publication ban on the mere fact of a person s arrest and on the name of a person sentenced to prison is justified and appropriate in the state of israel the principle of public trial and the right of the public to know are not consistent with the disappearance of a person from public sight and his descent into the abyss of prison zucker thus decided to turn to the prime minister the minister of justice and the cabinet legal advisor and request that they consider the question the state of israel is strong enough to withstand the cost incurred by abiding by the principle of public punishment the state of israel cannot be allowed to have prisoners whose detention and its cause is kept secret wrote zucker the legal counsel of the civil rights union attorney mordechai shiffman said that we as the civil rights union do not know of any cases of security prisoners citizens of israel who are imprisoned and whose imprisonment cannot be made public this is a situation which if it actually exists is definitely unhealthy just like censorship is an unhealthy matter the union is aware says shiffman of cases where notification of a suspect s arrest to family members and lawyers is withheld i am speaking only of several days i know also of cases where a detainee was not allowed to meet with an attorney sometimes for the whole first month of arrest that is done because of the great secrecy the suspect himself his family his lawyer or even a journalist can challenge the publication ban in court but there are cases where the family members themselves are not interested in publicity the journalist knows nothing of the arrest and so almost everyone is happy attorney yossi arnon an official of the bar claims that given the laws as they exist in israel today a situation where the arrest of a person for security offenses is kept secret is definitely possible nothing is easier the court orders a publication ban and that s that someone who has committed security offenses can spend long years in prison without us knowing anything about it do you find this situation acceptable attorney arnon definitely not we live in a democratic country and such a state of affairs is impermissible i am well aware that publication can be damaging from the standpoint of security but total non publication silence is unacceptable consider the trial of mordechai vanunu at least in his case we know that he was charged with aggravated espionage and sentenced to years in prison the trial was held behind closed doors nobody knew the details except for those who were authorized to it is somehow possible to understand though not to accept the reasons but as i have noted we at least are aware of his imprisonment why is the matter actually that serious can t we trust the discretion of the court attorney arnon the judges have no choice but to trust the presentations made to them the judges do not have the tools to investigate this gives the government enormous power power which they can misuse and what if there really is a security issue attorney arnon i am a man of the legal system not a security expert democracy stands in opposition to security i believe it is possible to publicize the matter of the arrest and the charges without entering into detail we have already seen how the laws concerning publication bans can be misused in the case of the rachel heller murder a suspect in the murder was held for many months without the matter being made public attorney shiffman on the other hand believes that state security can be a legitimate reason for prohibiting publication of a suspect s arrest or of a convicted criminal s imprisonment a healthy situation definitely not but i am aware of the fact that mere publication may be harmful to state security a different opinion is expressed by attorney uri shtendal former advisor for arab affairs to prime ministers levi eshkol and golda meir clearly we are speaking of isolated special cases such situations contrast with the principle that a judicial proceeding must be held in public no doubt this contradicts the principle of freedom of expression definitely also to the principle of individual freedom which is also harmed by the prohibition of publication nevertheless adds shtendal the legislator allowed for the possibility of such a ban to accommodate special cases where the damage possible as a consequence of publication is greater than that which may follow from an abridgment of the principles i ve mentioned the authority to decide such matters of publication does not rest with the prime minister or the security services but with the court which we may rest assured will authorize a publication ban only if it has been convinced of its need beyond a shadow of a doubt nevertheless attorney shtendal agrees as a rule clearly such a phenomenon is undesirable such an extreme step must be taken only in the most extreme circumstances yigal arens usc isi tv made me do it arens isi edu

4608###talk.politics.mideast###legality of the jewish purchase was re israeli expansion lust adam shostack writes sam zbib writes i m surprised that you don t consider the acquisition of land by the jews from arabs for the purpose of establishing an exclusive state as a hostile action leading to war it was for the purpose of establishing a state not an exclusive state if the state was to be exclusive it would not have arab citizens could you please tell me what was the ethnic composition of israel right after it was formed and no i do not consider the purchase of land a hostile action when someone wants to buy land and someone else is willing to sell it at a mutually agreeable price then that is commerce it is not a hostile action leading to war no one in his right mind would sell his freedom and dignity palestinians are no exception perhaps you heard about anti trust in the business world since we are debating the legality of a commercial transaction we must use the laws governing the guidelines and ethics of such transactions basic anti trust law says that while you can purchase ibm stocks for the purpose of investing you can not acquire a large number of those shares with the intent or controlling ibm you can do so only if you make your intentions clear apriori clearly the jews who purchased properties from palastenians had some designs they were not buying a dwelling or a real estate they were establishing a bridgehead for the european jews the palastenians sold their properties to the jews in the old tradition of arab hospitality being a multi ethnic multi religious society accepting the jews as neighbours was no different just another religion plus they paid fair market value etc they did not know they were victims of an international conspiracy i m not a conspiracy theorist myself but this one is hard to dismiss as to whether the jews wanted to live in peace maybe however they wanted and still want an exclusively jewish state where jews are in control and jews are the masters of the land living in peace is meaningless unless it means living with someone else as equal for a native arab this does not leave many options oh you mean like both jews and arabs being citizens the arabs who stayed are now citizens with as much right to choose who they vote for as the jews again adam the devil is in the details i don t want to get on a tangent here but its the same reasonning that says its ok to return deportes and leave the rest because is a nice number that you can devide by and besides it has an integer square root those palestinians who stayed actually stayed despite of what happened and their number was somewhat tolerated as a defenseless and ineffective minority if i were wrong you d have israel recall all the palestinian refugees we re talking millions after all they are civilians huh the people who left did so voluntarily there is no reason for israel to let them in do you actually believe this my experience tells me that every palestinian i knew still keeps the key to his home in palestine besides they often refer to their exodus as an escape from hell so to speak i know none that agrees with you did you sample their opinions i know you don t care just being rethorical israel gave citizenship to the remaining arabs because it had to maintain a democratic facade to keep the western aid flowing israel got no western aid in nor in or it still granted citizenship to those arabs who remained and how is granting citizenship a facade don t get me wrong i beleive that israel is democratic within the constraints of one dominant ethnic group jews israel probably had a few options after ethnic cleansing serbian style and deserve the wrath of the international community or make the best out of a no win condition show the world how good israel is towards the bad arabs personaly i ve never heard anything about the arab community in isreal except that they re there so yes they re there but as a community with history and roots its dead tell me something sam what makes land arab how shall i explain its a contract between the man and the land control isn t it the ottomans ruled years and then left with barely a trace the concept of land identity is somewhat foreign to the mobile and pragmatic west it is partly the concept of le sol natal native soil i know that jews had previous history in the region but none in recent memory i m talking everyday life not archeology try again you tell me what its isn t but you fail to establish what it is also jews did have history in israel for over a thousand years there were lots of jews slaughtered by crusaders in israel there was a thriving community in gaza city from roughly jews were a majority in jerusalem from or so onwards does that make the land jewish i stand corrected i meant that the jewish culture was not predominant in palestine in recent history i have no problem with jerusalem having a jewish character if it were

not were uniforms but goes out of its way to look like civilians they are judging that the benefit they will receive from this cover is more important that the harm that will come to civilians this is a comment on the israeli experience and is saying that the guerillas do have some responsibility in putting civilians in the middle of this fight by putting on uniforms and living apart from civilians barracks etc the guerillas would significantly lower the risk to civilians but if the guerillas do this aren t they putting themselves at greater risk absolutely they ask themselves why set ourselves apart by wearing uniforms when there is a ready made cover for us civilians that makes sense from their point of view but when this cover is used the guerillas should accept some of the responsibility for subsequent harm to civilians if the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on israel is it not working why is it further neccessary for israeli guns to pound lebanese villages why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone you see there is more to the shelling of the villages it is called retaliation getting back getting even it doesn t make sense to shell the villages the least it shows is a reckless disregard by the israeli government for the lives of civilians i agree with you here i have always thought that israel s bombing sortees and bombing policy is stupid thoughtless inhumane and ineffective but there is no reason that israel should passive wait until attackers chose to act there is every reason to believe that taking the fight to the enemy will do more to stop attacks as i said previously israel spent several decades sitting passively on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks after the attackers had entered israeli territory it didn t work very well the host arab state did little nothing to try and stop these attacks from its side of the border with israel so the number of attacks were considerably higher as was their physical and psychological impact on the civilians caught in their path what so the whole bit about attacks on israel from neighboring arab states can start all over again while i also hope for this to happen it will only occur when arab states show that they are prepared to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on israel from their soil they have to prove it or provide some guaratees there is no way israel is going to accept their word not with their past attitude of tolerance towards anti israel guerillas in residence if israel is not willing to accept the word of others then imho it has no business wasting others time coming to the peace talks this is just another selectively applied statement the reason for this drawn out impasse between ababs palestinians and israelis is that neither side is willing to accept the word of the other by your criteria everyone should stay away from the negotiations that is precisely why the palestinians in their recent pisga proposal for the interim period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy are demanding conditions that essentially define autonomy already they do not trust that israel will follow through the entire process and allow palestinians to reach full autonomy do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the palestinians if you do then why should israel s view of arabs palestinians be any different why should they trust the arab palestinians words since they don t they are very reluctant to give up tangible assets land control of areas in exchange for words for this reason they are also concerned about the sorts of guarantees they will have that the arabs will follow through on their part of any agreement reached but don t you see that the same statement can be made both ways if lebanon was interested in peace then it should accept the word of israel that the attacks were the cause for war and disarming the hizbollah will remove the cause for its continued occupancy absolutely so are the arabs palestinians asking first for the israelis word in relation to any agreement no what is being demanded first is land when the issue is land and one party finally gets hold of this land what the other party does is totally irrelevent if i now have possession of this land your words have absolutely no power whether israel chooses to keeps its word does not get the land back afterall israel has already staged two parts of the withdrawal from areas it occupied in lebanon during slg tim you are ignoring the fact that the palestinians in lebanon have been disarmed hezbollah remains the only independent militia hezbollah does not attack israel except at a few times such as when the idf burned up sheikh mosavi his wife and young son while the major armaments those allowing people to wage civil wars have been removed the weapons needed to cross border attacks still remain to some extent rocket attacks still continue and commando raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard for human life yours of that of others such attacks also continue of course if israel would withdraw from lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn t make the lebanese so mad as to do that bat guano the situation you call for existed in the s and attacks were commonplace furthermore with hezbollah subsequently disarmed it would not be possible there is no way these groups can be effectively disarmed unless the state is as authoritarian is syria s the only other way is for lebanon to take it upon itself to constantly patrol the entire border with israel essentially mirroring israel s border secirity on its side it has to prove to isreal that it is this committed to protecting israel from attack from lebanese territory once syria leaves who is to say that lebanon will be able to retain control if syria stays thay may be even more dangerous for israel tim when is the last time that you recall any trouble on the syrian border not lately eh that s what i said ok but doesn t that mean that syria has to take over lebanon i don t think israel or lebanon would like that what both sides need is to receive something tangible the arabs palestinians are looking for land and demanding that they receive it prior to giving anything to israel israel has two problems if it gives up real land it is exposing itself to a changed geostrategic situation and that change doesn t help israel s position and when it gives up this land it needs to receive something in return to compensate for the increased risks tim

4615###talk.politics.mideast###the hamas way of death the hamas way of death following is a transcript of a recruitment and training videotape made last summer by the qassam battalions the military arm of hamas an islamic palestinian group hamas figures significantly in the middle east equation in december israel deported more than palestinians to lebanon in response to hamas s kidnapping and execution of an israeli soldier a longer version appears in the may issue of harper s magazine which obtained and translated the tape my name is yasir hammad al hassan ali i live in nuseirat a refugee camp in the gaza strip i was born in i finished high school then attended gaza polytechnic later i went to work for islamic university in gaza as a clerk i m married and i have two daughters the qassam battalions are the only group in palestine explicitly dedicated to jihad holy war our primary concern is palestinians who collaborate with the enemy many young men and women have fallen prey to the cunning traps laid by the israeli security services since our enemies are trying to obliterate our nation cooperation with them is clearly a terrible crime our most important objective must be to put an end to the plague of collaboration to do so we abduct collaborators intimidate and interrogate them in order to uncover other collaborators and expose the methods that the enemy uses to lure palestinians into collaboration in the first place in addition to that naturally we confront the problem of collaborators by executing them we don t execute every collaborator after all about percent of them are innocent victims tricked or black mailed into their misdeeds the decision whether to execute a collaborator is based on the seriousness of his crimes if like many collaborators he has been recruited as an agent of the israeli border guard then it is imperative that he be executed at once he s as dangerous as an israeli soldier so we treat him like an israeli soldier there s another group of collaborators who perform an even more loathsome role the ones who help the enemy trap young men and women in blackmail schemes that force them to become collaborators i regard the isqat the process by which a palestinians is blackmailed into collaboration of single person as greater crime than the killing of a demonstrator if someone is guilty of causing repeated cases of isqat than it is our religious duty to execute him a third group of collaborators is responsible for the distribution of narcotics they work on direct orders from the security services to distribute drugs as widely as possible their victims become addicted and soon find it unbearable to quit and impossible to afford more they collaborate in order to get the drugs they crave the dealers must also be executed in the battalions we have developed a very careful method of uncovering collaborators we can t afford to abduct an innocent person because once we seize a person his reputation is tarnished forever we will abduct and interrogate a collaborator only after evidence of his guilt has been established never before if after interrogation the collaborator is found guilty beyond any doubt then he is executed in many cases we don t have to make our evidence against collaborators public because everyone knows that they re guilty but when the public isn t aware that a certain individual is a collaborator and we accuse him people are bound to ask for evidence many people will proclaim his innocence so there must be irrefutable proof before he is executed this proof is usually obtained in the form of a confession at first every collaborator denies his crimes so we start off by showing the collaborator the testimony against him we tell him that he still has a chance to serve his people even in the last moment of his life by confessing and giving us the information we need we say that we know his repentance in sincere and that he has been a victim that kind of talk is convincing most of them confess after that others hold out in those cases we apply pressure both psychological and physical then the holdouts confess as well only one collaborator has ever been executed without an interrogation in that case the collaborator had been seen working for the border guard since before the intifada and he himself confessed his involvement to a friend who disclosed the information to us in addition three members of his network of collaborators told us that he had caused their isqat with this much evidence there was no need to interrogate him but we are very careful to avoid wrongful executions in every case our principal is the same the accused should be interrogated until he himself confesses his crimes a few weeks ago we sat down and complied a list of collaborators to decide whether there were any who could be executed without interrogation an although we had hundreds of names still because of our fear of god and of hell we could not mark any of these men except for the one i just mentioned for execution when we execute a collaborator in public we use a gun but after we abduct and interrogate a collaborator we can t shoot him to do so might give away our locations that s why collaborators are strangled sometimes we ask the collaborator what do you think how should we execute you one collaborator told us strangle me he hated the sight of blood naftaly

press madness from the israeli press paper zman tel aviv tel aviv s time friday local tel aviv s paper affiliated with maariv date february journalist guy ehrlich subject interview with soldiers who served in the duvdevan cherry units which disguise themselves as arabs and operate within the occupied territories excerpts from the article a lot has been written about the units who disguise themselves as arabs things good and bad some of the falsehoods but the most important problem of those units has been hardly dealt with it is that everyone who serves in the cherry after a time goes in one way or another insane a man who said this who will here be called danny his full name is known to the editors served in the cherry after his discharge from the army he works as delivery boy his pal who will here be called dudu was also serving in the cherry and is now about to depart for a round the world tour they both look no different from average israeli youngsters freshly discharged from conscript service but in their souls one can notice something completely different it was not easy for them to come out with disclosures about what happened to them and they think that to most of their fellows from the cherry it woundn t be easy either yet after they began to talk it was nearly impossible to make them stop talking the following article will contain all the horror stories recounted with an appalling openness a short time ago i was in command of a veteran team in which some of the fellows applied for release from the cherry we called such soldiers h i hit by the intifada under my command was a soldier who talked to himself non stop which is a common phenomenon in the cherry i sent him to a psychiatrist but why i should talk about others when i myself feel quite insane on fridays when i come home my parents know i cannot be talked to until i go to the beach surf a little calm down and return the keys of my father s car must be ready for in advance so that i can go there i they dare talk to me before or whenever i don t want them to talk to me i just grab a chair and smash it instantly i know it is my nerve smashing chairs all the time and then running away from home to the car and to the beach only there i become normal another friday i was eating a lunch prepared by my mother it was an omelette of sorts she took the risk of sitting next to me and talking to me i then told my mother about an event which was still fresh in my mind i told her how i shot an arab and how exactly his wound looked like when i went to inspect it she began to laugh hysterically i wanted her to cry and she dared laugh straight in my face instead so i told her how my pal had made a mincemeat of the two arabs who were preparing the molotov cocktails he shot them down hitting them beautifully exactly as they deserved one bullet had set a molotov cocktail on fire with the effect that the arab was burning all over just beautifully i was delighted to see it my pal fired three bullets two at the arab with the molotov cocktail and the third at his chum it hit him straight in his ass we both felt that we d pulled off something next i told my mother how another pal of mine split open the guts in the belly of another arab and how all of us ran toward that spot to take a look i reached the spot first and then that arab blood gushing forth from his body spits at me i yelled shut up and he dared talk back to me in hebrew so i just laughed straight in his face i am usually laughing when i stare at something convulsing right before my eyes then i told him all right wait a moment i left him in order to take a look at another wounded arab i asked a soldier if that arab could be saved if the bleeding from his artery could be stopped with the help of a stone of something else like that i keep telling all this to my mother with details and she keeps laughing straight into my face this infuriated me i got very angry because i felt i was becoming mad so i stopped eating seized the plate with he omelette and some trimmings still on and at once threw it over her head only then she stopped laughing at first she didn t know what to say but i must tell you of a still other madness which falls upon us frequently i went with a friend to practice shooting on a field a gull appeared right in the middle of the field my friend shot it at once then we noticed four deer standing high up on the hill above us my friend at once aimed at one of them and shot it we enjoyed the sight of it falling down the rock we shot down two deer more and went to take a look when we climbed the rocks we saw a young deer badly wounded by our bullet but still trying to such some milk from its already dead mother we carefully inspected two paths covered by blood and chunks of torn flesh of the two deer we had hit we were just delighted by that sight we had hit em so good then we decided to kill the young deer too so as spare it further suffering i approached took out my revolver and shot him in the head several times from a very short distance when you shoot straight at the head you actually see the bullets sinking in but my fifth bullet made its brains fall outside onto the ground with the effect of splattering lots of blood straight on us this made us feel cured of the spurt of our madness standing there soaked with blood we felt we were like beasts of prey we couldn t explain what had happened to us we were almost in tears while walking down from that hill and we felt the whole day very badly we always go back to places we carried out assignments in this is why we can see them when you see a guy you disabled may be for the rest of his life you feel you got power you feel godlike of sorts both danny and dudu contemplate at least at this moment studying the acting dudu is not willing to work in any security linked occupation danny feels the exact opposite why shouldn t i take advantage of the skills i have mastered so well why shouldn t i earn for each chopped head i would deliver while being a mercenary in south africa this kind of job suits me perfectly i have no human emotions any more if i get a reasonable salary i will have no

the warsaw ghetto they repress by violent means the uprising of the gaza ghetto and attempt to starve the gazans your comparison with the warsaw ghetto uprising is insulting and racist beyond belief the attempts to quiet any violence in the gaza strip are just that the efforts to quell murder and mayhem in the gaza strip were the resluts of violence and came after the violence it was not an arbitrary racial move like the nazi treatment of jews jews had not committed acts of violence and murder as have the residents of gaza i find your eagerness to ignore the acts of murder nothing more than anti israel bigotry the gaza strip this tiny area of land with the highest population density in the world has been cut off from the world for weeks the israeli occupier has decided to punish the whole population of gaza some people by denying them the right to leave the strip and seek work in israel it is not punishment but protection from repeated attacks by residents of gaza you self servingly omit any references to why israel has had to take action apparaently the deaths of innocent israeli civilians do not enter into your equation a racist ommission on your part while polish non jews risked their lives to save jews from the ghetto no israeli jew is known to have risked his life to help the gazan resistance the only help given to gazans by israeli jews only dozens of people is humanitarian assistance the right of the gazan population to resist occupation is recognized in international law and by any person with a sense of justice a population denied basic human rights is entitled to rise up against its tormentors the right of israel to protect its citizens from murderers is also recognized by international law israeli civilians have been getting stabbed to death on a daily basis if this wave of murder does not matter to you then your posturing for the basic human rights you claim matter so much to you is nothing but an anti israel charade as is known the israeli regime is considering gazans unworthy of israeli citizenship and equal rights in israel although they are considered worthy to do the dirty work in israeli hotels shops and fields do you know of residents of gaza who have applied for israeli citizenship and were denied i have heard of no such denials taking place can you document this or is this more of your stupid and innacurate propaganda the truth is that if gazan residents applied for citizenship hamas would murder them as collaborators many gazans are born in towns and villages located in israel they may not live there for these areas are reserved for the master race how dare you use such a disgusting phrase how very easy you attack a people when you omit facts which fly in the face of your pure racism perhaps you are judging a people to be the racists that you are do you believe that all jews must have the same bigoted makeup as you here s another little fly in your ointment about the master race for you to avoid two months ago a plane with bosnian muslims left bosnia to seek asylum in the middle east four arab nations refused to grant them asylum then when israli arabs agreed to take the responsibility for them they were allowed into israel yes israel but when the plane landed the israeli arabs who had previously agreed to take care of them refused to be involved with the rescue project because they felt that it would make israel look good it was more important to avoid any good pr for israel than to take care of fellow muslims israel moved them to a kibbutz where they are safe and secure the truth is that time after time the islamic world has turned its back on muslims in need more than israel has even in the case of the deportees lebanon was willing to let their so called arab brothers freeze to death rather than give them sanctuary in lebanon nearly twice as many palestinians have been murdered by other palestinians than in confrontations with israel hundreds of thousands of palestinians had been deported from kuwait just because they were palestinian the truth is that your phoney concern for the welfare of the palestinians is nothing but an excuse to attack israel you are part of the ignorant effort to confine all concern for the welfare of the palestinians to attacking israel but the truth is there are greater reasons than israel for the plight of the palestinians to disregard jordan or kuwait or saudi arabia or any of the other oil rich nations who do nothing for these people is to use the plight of these poor people as a vehicle for your hatred of jews or your hatred of israel anti semitism and anti zionism is not the same as pro palestinian and anyone who insists that it is the same really does not give two hoots for their welfare the nazi regime accorded to the residents of the warsaw ghetto the right to self administration they selected jews to pacify the occupied population and preventing any form of resistance some jewish collaborators were killed israel also wishes to rule over gaza through arab collaborators your pathetic analogy is so absent of relevant fact that your racism cannot be disguised jews had never declared war on a polish people jews had never attacked poles with knives or had used the ghetto as a staging ground for attacks to take something like the warsaw ghetto the creation of which you do not even bother to discuss and the uprising that followed is to degrade the dead and to show that intelligent debate on a difficult situation is beyond your intellectual purview you clearly have never even read a single word of the covenant of the islamic resistance movement here is arguably the single most anti semitic genocidal document since mein kampf yet it is totally disregarded in your rantings your racism is most evident in your eagerness to avoid such documentation if it were considered you might actually have to deal with mideast problems in a balanced manner rather than in an anti semitic manner as israel denies gazans the only two options which are compatible with basic human rights and international law that of becoming israeli citizens with full rights or respecting their right for self determination it must be concluded that the israeli jewish society does not consider gazans full human beings and just how was gaza obtained do you forget that israel is not in the habit of grabbing land for the hell of it but had taken gaza in a war that it did not start did you know land israel captures in wars wars which other nations have always started aren t the same as israel and they are subject to a completely different set of international laws since you do continuously refer to international law would you please say what specific international laws israel is violating this attitude is consistent with the attitude of the nazis towards jews i can cite reasons why it is not the current policies by the israeli government of cutting off gaza are consistent with the wish publicly expressed by prime mininister yitzhak rabin that gaza sink into the sea where is this quote i have never heard rabin assert that he wished such a thing since you are in general a liar you ll have to provide the entire quote with source or this effort will be regarded as just another one of your fabrications one is led to ask oneself whether israeli leaders entertain still more sinister goals towards the gazans whether they have some final solution up their sleeve only you are led to ask such a loaded racist intellectually dishonest question you inability to come to terms with what you are has turned you into a racist of the highest order i urge all those who have slight human compassion to do whatever they can to help the gazans regain their full human civil and political rights to which they are entitled as human beings why do you not feel the same compassion for the jews of iran or iraq or yemen or saudi arabia or syria do you have an inkling of what they have endured over the past decades or what about the plight of the palestinians in kuwait or what about the treatment of the bosnian muslims do you think the residents of gaza are being subjected to what all the muslims in bosnia are enduring why are you indifferent to the death and suffering of people why do you not care that these folk are being exterminated why do you not care that only israel has given any of these people safe haven could it be due to the fact that it is not israel who is doing the killing the people in gaza are not being exterminated they aren t being killed they aren t being raped they aren t being starved they aren t being driven from their lands they are not kept from receiving food or other supplies but the bosnians are and the only country which has provided some sanctuary to the bosnian muslims is the same nation that you have devoted your life to attacking in the guise of compassion your rantings are so unfettered by the burden of intellectual honesty that you ought to take a deep breath and ask yourself what your real motives are do not flatter yourself into the belief that truth or compassion are what drives you in your case it is clear that hate beats out love every time maybe you are burdened with some kind of guilt for having been born a jew it is obvious that your hatred of your own judaism is being dumped on all other jews why else would you suggest a racist idea like breeding jews out of existence maybe these fits of anti semitism are a result of being cut off from your own people for an extended period whatever the case may be it is clear that you are not what you have labored so hard to appear to be when you realize that you can t care for other people while you hate yourself you might actually begin to do some good but for now you are a fruad

it from their balconies told us they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of blocks as far as the mortgage bank that s a good block and a half or two from here i know this for sure because i saw it myself deposition of tatyana mikhailovna arutunian nezhintseva born train conductor azerbaijani railroad resident at building apartment microdistrict no sumgait azerbaijan i hadn t lived very long in sumgait only eight years i moved there from novosibirsk my son entered the baku nautical school and so i transferred to azerbaijan later i met someone and married him and now my name is arutunian my husband s name that there would be a massacre was not discussed openly but there were hints and gibes so to speak at the armenian people and they were mocking the russians too i was constantly aware of it at work and not just this past year i couldn t find a definite place for myself in the pool at work because i i ll just say it couldn t steal couldn t deceive and couldn t be involved in bribe taking and when i asked for decent working conditions they told me leave don t keep the others from working you aren t cut out for this kind of work and at work and around all the time i would hear gibes at the armenians like the turks had it right they killed them all the way they ve multiplied here they re making it hard for us to live and things will be just fine if we get rid of them all no problem the turks will help they say if we ask them they ll rid armenia of armenians in half an hour well that s the way it all was but i never thought of course that it would spill over into a bloody tragedy because you just couldn t imagine it here we ve been living under the soviet government for years and no one even considered such an idea possible but i had been forming my own opinions and in the presence of authoritative people i would often ask where is this all leading do people really not see what kind of situation is emerging here the russians are fleeing sumgait there are very few of them left why is no one dealing with this what s going on and when it all happened on the th and th it became clear that everything had been arranged by someone because what else are you to make of it if the first secretary of the city party committee is marching ahead of the demonstration with an azerbaijani flag i wouldn t be saying this now if i hadn t received personal confirmation from him later because when we were under guard in the sk club on the st he came to the club that muslimzade the women told me there he is there he is that s muslimzade i didn t believe the rumors that he had carried an azerbaijani flag i thought that they were just false rumors i went over to him and said are you the first secretary of our city party committee he answers me yes and i ask him tell me did you really march ahead of that gang carrying an azerbaijani flag and behind you they were carrying denigrating signs i don t know exactly what they said but there was mention of armenian blood and he tells me yes i was there but i tried to dissuade them from it then i asked him another question and where were you when they were burning and slaughtering us and he said i we didn t know what to do we didn t know we didn t anticipate that that would happen in sumgait comrade mamedov the first deputy chairman of the council of ministers of the azerbaijani ssr answered the same question for me no we actually didn t anticipate the slaughter in sumgait at that time we were trying to contain the crowd of in baku that was preparing for a massacre those are his exact words the ones he said in the office of the council of ministers of the armenian ssr and now about the events themselves of course it s painful to discuss them because it may seem that it s not true to someone else various rumors concerning what happened are making the rounds some are true others aren t but unfortunately there are more true ones than false because it was so horrible in our age here in the space age the age of science the age of progress i don t know if someone had told me this story if i were living in or around moscow i wouldn t have believed it why not because it was really a genocide it was a massacre that s genuinely what it was for example on that day the th i didn t know about the th because my husband and i were both sick both of us had the flu and we were in bed on the th our neighbor comes to our place and says you re in bed you don t know anything about it there was a demonstration in town and after it they were overturning armenian cars and burning them they were looking into cars and asking are you an armenian if they answered in armenian then they turned the car over and burned it this isn t made up the wife of the senior investigator of the baku ministry of internal affairs told us he was returning home from his dacha with his wife raisa sevastyanova she s my neighbor she immediately came and told lis that they had landed right in the middle of it i don t know what to call it the cavalcade of automobiles they were stopping he answered in azerbaijani they let them go but they made him honk the horn they were kicking up a fracas we didn t even believe it and i said certainly that didn t happen how can that be and she said muslimzade was leading the crowd and the sputnik store was completely smashed because most of the salespeople there are armenians and when he saw that they had started breaking the glass in that store he said don t break the shop windows don t destroy state property but do whatever else you want i didn t hear this with my own two ears but it is a fact that the store was torn up and the director of the store was beaten for employing armenians although he s an azerbaijani while we were talking all of a sudden right across from us sevastyanova is the first to look out the window and say look there s a crowd out there and sure enough when we looked out there we saw that the crowd had already started wrecking the neighboring building there was an armenian family there a woman and two girls they lived across from us i m sorry i don t know the building number or the people s names since we were in my husband s apartment in microdistrict and i lived in microdistrict no there was awful looting going on there at the time the most hideous things were going on there then one building there ours was attacked twice once wasn t enough for them they returned to the places where they hadn t finished the armenians off if an azerbaijani family dared to conceal armenians they beat the azerbaijanis too they also beat russians if it was russians doing the hiding because there were russians among them they said so on television there were people of various nationalities but they didn t tell us why there were people of different nationalities because they wouldn t have touched the azerbaijanis if they hadn t dared to stick up for the armenians and give them temporary shelter in their homes at the time i saw this from the window i was there sevastyanova was there and so was my husband we went out onto the balcony and saw a television fly off a balcony all kinds of things even a sofa then when it was all down there they burned it up then we saw the crowd and they were all oohing at first i couldn t figure out what was happening and later i told my husband lendrush l think they re beating someone out there and he answered i don t know could be suddenly the crowd separated for a moment and i saw it and raisa sevastyanova saw it too my husband had turned the other way he didn t see it i saw a naked girl with her hair down they were dragging her she kept falling because they were pushing her and kicking her she fell down it was muddy there and later other witnesses who saw it from their balconies told us they seized her by the hair and dragged her a couple of blocks as far as the mortgage bank that s a good block and a half or two from here i know this for sure because i saw it myself then the crowd rushed toward our building we were standing there and you can of course imagine what we were feeling were they going to kill us or not and i also had the awful thought that they might torment me the way they tormented that woman because i had just seen that i asked my husband i gave him an axe and said you kill me first and then let them do what they want with the corpse but our neighbors it s true defended us they said there aren t any armenians in our entryway go away only muslims live here disaster missed us that time but at two o clock in the morning a crowd of about people approximately came back to our place my husband was already asleep he can sleep when he s upset about something but i can t i was standing running from balcony to balcony our power was out i don t remember for how long but it was as though it had been deliberately turned off there were no lights whatsoever and i was glad of course i thought it was better that way but then i look and the crowd is at our balcony this was at in the morning the first time they were at our building it was and now it was in the morning but i never thought that that old woman on the first floor the azerbaijani was awake and watching out there were human beings among them too so she goes out with a pail of garbage as though she needed to be taking garbage out at two o clock in the morning she used it as a pretext and went toward those young people they really were youngsters from my balcony you could see perfectly that they were young azerbaijani boys they spoke azerbaijani and when they came up to her she said what do you want and they answered we want the armenian family that lives here pointing toward the second floor with their hands she says i already told you we don t have any armenians here now leave do you hear this is an old muslim woman talking to you and grabbed the hand of one boy who was trying to walk around her and enter the building anyway and started pushing him away and so they seemed to listen to her they were all very young they started apologizing and left that was the second time death was at our door i forgot to mention about one other apartment a man named rubik lives there i don t know him really i knew his daughter i mean i saw her around but we really didn t know them but i do know that that guy who lives on the fourth floor across from our entryway went to chernobyl and worked there for eight months to earn money can you imagine what that means he risked his life to earn x amount of money in order to better his family he bought new furniture and was getting ready to give his daughter s hand in marriage but alas everything was ruined by those creeps and scoundrels they threw everything out the windows and the rest we saw from our balcony how the neighbors on the left and right ran into the apartment and carried off everything that hadn t already been smashed or taken what is one to think of that it means that the parents in those families were in on it too unfortunately i came to be of the opinion that it was all organized and that everything had been foreseen in advance both the beating of the armenians and the stripping of apartments something on the order of we ll move the armenians out and take over their apartments i have worked honestly my whole life you can check everything about me i came as a patriot from china waited for nights on end in front of the consulate general of the ussr i came to my homeland as a patriot because i knew that the party and the komsomol were holy things but when i saw in sumgait that there wasn t anything holy about them that party membership was bought that komsomol members joined only for personal gain that there were no ideals no ideas god save me everything was being bought and sold i saw all of it and understood how they could allow that crap to go on like it did i can t talk any more about it the image of that beating when i went out of my own apartment they picked us up under soviet army guard they had arrived from all over to suppress that gang not only armenians but some russian families and their children too came out of their apartments and joined us because no normal person who had seen that could stay there with the situation the way it was and what s interesting is that when we left on the buses i rode and thought that at least one group of people for sure people would basically rise to the situation would have some compassion for the armenians would somehow understand the injustice of what was done but having analyzed and weighed the whole thing once i calmed down having thought it all through i came to a conclusion that is shared by many people if a lot of azerbaijanis didn t want their armenian neighbors to be killed and that basically depended on that muslimzade he said that he had wanted to calm them down then is it possible that he didn t have people at hand to whom he could whisper at the last minute go and announce it on television citizens of sumgait take what you can into your hands let s protect our neighbors from this massacre those crowds weren t such that there was no controlling them basically they were unarmed they didn t have firearms mostly they had knives they had all kinds of metal parts like armature shafts sharpened at the ends special rocks different to a degree that we noticed them there aren t rocks like those in sumgait soils they were brought from somewhere as though it were all specially planned so as i was saying i weighed it all out and if any of our neighbors had wanted to defend us why wasn t it arranged it means that the government didn t want to do it when the crowd was moving from the city party committee to the sputnik what there was no way of informing baku no there was no way it turns out the crowd was doing violence in our microdistrict i won t mention the things i didn t see myself i ll only talk about the things i myself witnessed they were in microdistrict beginning at o clock in the evening when i saw them from the other building and they were somewhere else until mid night or one o clock in the morning because at they came back to our building they hadn t completely finished making their predatory rounds of microdistrict when they returned to our building i told my husband lendrush now the police are probably going to come my god now the authorities are probably going to find out and come to our aid well alas no there were to be no authorities not a single policeman not a single fireman not a single ambulance came while they were raging as it turns out as we later found out beginning on the might of the th there were dead people ruined apartments and burned autos one car near the bus station it was burned and overturned it was probably there about four days everyone saw it and what went on in block those who live there know they saw from their balconies how they attacked the soldiers in the buses how they beat those poor unarmed soldiers and how on that square i can t remember the name of it where there is that fork coming from the bus station that intersection now i m upset and i can t think of the name there s a tall building there a story and from the balconies there people saw that butchery when the poor soldiers wearing only helmets with shields and those unfortunate clubs moved against that mob and when they fell those to year old boys ran up and using stones big heavy stones beat them to death on their heads who could have guessed that something like that could happen in the soviet union and under the soviet government the upshot is that this republic has not been under soviet control for a long time but no one wanted to pay any attention or get involved if you were to go and ask at my work many people would confirm that i tell the truth i ve been struggling for truth for five years there already the five years that i worked at the azerbaijani railroad some people there considered me a demagogue others who knows what some think i m an adventure seeker and some a prankster but i wanted everything to be right i would become outraged how can this be why is it people treat one another this way on a soviet railroad as though the azerbaijani railroad were azerbaijani property or the property of some magnate or some mafia if i want to i ll get you out of here if i want to i ll get rid of you if i want to i ll do something else and there s a black market price for everything in the most brazen way a coach to moscow costs so much a coach on a local train costs so much once when i was complaining to the head of the conductor s pool he had the nerve to tell me maybe you won t even believe this but this i m afraid i heard with my own ears tatyana just how long can you fight for something that you know will never have any effect you re alone against everyone so instead why don t you give more money to the chief conductor and everything will go fine for you i started to cry turned and left what else could i do where else could i go to complain i realized that everything was useless and the root of the whole thing is that it all goes on and no one wants to see it i filed a written complaint and they ground it into dust they destroyed it i still have a copy but what s the use when the general procuracy got involved with the investigation of the bloody sumgait affair in addition to the information about what i saw what i was a witness to i gave testimony about the mafia at the railroad they accepted my petition but i don t know if they re going to pursue it or not because you ll excuse me i no longer believe in the things i aspired to the things i believed in before it s all dead they just spit on my soul stomped on everything physically and most important spiritually because you can lose belongings that s nonsense that all comes with time but when your soul is spit upon and when the best in you your beliefs are destroyed it can be very difficult to restore them i want to tell of one incident i just don t know at the time i was in such a state that i didn t even take minor things into account here is an example of course it s not a minor one my neighbor raisa sevastyanova she has a son valery who is in the th grade in a school in microdistrict a boy vitaly danielian i don t know his last name goes to school with him or rather went to school with him i was just sitting in an apartment trying to make a phone call to moscow oh yes and there s one important detail when the massacre began for two to three hours the phones weren t working in armenian apartments and later in several russian and azerbaijani apartments but the fact of the matter is that service was shut off you could not call anywhere why again it means it was all planned how come service is cut off for no reason and the lights went off and those brats were raging as they liked they weren t afraid they ran about freely they that no one would slap their hands and no one would dare to stop them they knew it now i m going to tell about the incident so this little vitaly vitalik an armenian boy went to school with valery they were in the same class according to what valery and his neighbor pal said at the time i was in the same apartment as they were i sat at the phone waiting for the call to be put through a mob attacked the building where vitalik lived so valery ran to his mother and said mamma please let me go to vitalik s what if they kill him maybe he s still alive maybe we can bring him here and save him somehow he s a nice guy we all like him he s a good person he s smart his mother wouldn t let him go in tears she says valery you can t go because i am afraid he says mamma we can get around the crowd we ll just watch just have a look they made it through i don t know i think vitalik s parents lived in microdistrict no and when they got there they made a superficial deduction knowing that balconies and doors were being broken everywhere that you could see from the street which were the armenian apartments in the building they went here and there and looked and saw that the windows were intact and so they calmed down but even though the windows in that apartment were not broken everything inside was totally smashed and vitalik lay there with a broken skull and his mother and father had already been murdered little vitalik didn t even know they were dead so two weeks ago i don t know he was in critical condition no maybe it was longer we left sumgait on march spent some time in moscow and then we came to yerevan so it s been about a month already it s so hard to keep all this straight so valery the next day when he found out that vitalik s family has been killed and vitalik was ling in the semashko hospital in baku valery and his classmates got together and went to visit him but they wouldn t admit them telling them that he was in critical condition and that he was still in a coma they cried and left having also found out that the girl i saw being kicked and dragged was in that hospital too as it turns out she was brought there in serious condition but at least she was alive at the time when we got to the sk club we would see first one friend and then another throw ourselves into their arms and kiss them because you had wondered if these friends were alive or not if those friends were alive or not and when you saw them you were so glad to find out that the family had lived when you saw people you heard things that made your hair stand on end if you publish everything that happened it will be a hideous book a book of things it is even difficult to believe and those two girls who were raped were entirely black and blue the ones at the sk they know i m not lying that girlfriend came up to one of them and said what happened and she bared her breasts and they were completely covered in cigarette burns those rogues had put cigarettes out on her breasts after something like that i don t know how you can live in a city and look at the people in it now when we stayed at the military unit for a while they provided well basic conditions for us there the military unit is located in nasosny some six miles from sumgait and living there we met with a larger group of people there were about people at the unit you know there was a point when i couldn t even go outside because if you went outside you saw so much heartbreak around you and when you hear the false rumors yes by the way false rumors were spread in sumgait saying that the armenians around yerevan had destroyed azerbaijani villages and razed them to the ground with bulldozers i didn t know whether to believe it or not and people who don t know any better get the idea that it was all done in revenge but when i arrived in armenia and was in spitak and in spitak all those villages are not only intact but at that time had even been protected just in case they were guarded they got better food than did the inhabitants of spitak not a single person there died and no one is planning to harm them around yerevan all the villages are safe and unharmed and the armenians didn t attack anyone but actually after an evil of the magnitude suffered in sumgait there could have been a feeling of vengefulness but no one acted on it and i don t know why you sometimes hear accusations to the effect that the armenians are guilty that it is they who organized it rumors like that are being spread in azerbaijan and if one old person says it and ten young ones hear it they not only perceive it with their minds but with their hearts too to them it seems that the older person is telling the truth for example one says did you know that out of people killed by the way originally they said people but later they found a nd were azerbaijani and one was an armenian of course i m upset but it s utterly impossible to discuss such things and not become upset sometimes l forget things but i know i want to return to the time when we were in the sk club across from the city party committee when i saw muslimzade in the sk club building i went to him to ask because i couldn t believe that he had marched in the front carrying a banner i already mentioned this and if i repeat anything please excuse me i asked him why did you do that and why are you here now why did you come here to laugh at these women who are strewn about on the floor the overcrowding there was tremendous it was completely unsanitary and several of the children were already sick it s true the troops tried to make it livable for us they cooked for us on their field stoves and provided us with wonderful food but the thing is that their main job was to ferret out the gang that was still at it everywhere that was continuing its sordid affairs everywhere plus they were never given any direct orders they didn t know what they were authorized to do and not to do and it was only on march at five o clock in the evening that krayev himself the lieutenant general the city commandant of sumgait was given full authority and told everyone over a microphone from an armored personnel carrier that now he could do what he wanted to do as his heart advised him and relocate people to the military unit but that s not what i want to talk about now muslimzade characteristically tried to get me out of the sk building and take me to the city party committee which is across the square from the club he took me by the hand and said citizen don t worry we ll go and have a talk in my office i told him no after everything you ve done i don t believe one iota of what you say if i go to the city party committee i ll disappear and the traces of me will disappear too because you can t stand it when oh yes and there was another interesting detail from that meeting it was even very funny although at the time i wasn t up to laughing he was in a nice expensive hat and so as to put him to shame so to speak i said oh why did you come here all duded up like a london dandy you smell of good perfume you re in your starched shirt and you have your expensive hat on you came to ridicule the poor women and children who are lying on the floor who are already getting sick whose relatives have died did you come to laugh at them and the one who was accompanying him an azerbaijani i don t know who he was or what his title was he quickly snatched the hat off muslimzade s head and hid it then i said my god we re not marauders we re not you we didn t come to you with the intention of stealing well kill me kill me muslimzade says to me but i m not guilty kill me kill me but i m not guilty and i say ok fine you re not guilty have it your way but give us an answer we re asking you where were you when they were torturing and raping those poor women when they were killing the children burning things carrying on outrageously and wrecking all those apartments where were you then you know we didn t expect it we did not know what to do we didn t anticipate that something like that would happen in sumgait i started laughing and said it s truly funny he says what could i do we didn t know what to do and i say i m sorry but it ll be ridiculous if i tell you the first secretary of the city party committee shouldn t march out in front with a banner he should fall down so that the gang would have to cross over his dead body that s what you should have done that s the way it was during the war not a single party committee secretary compromised himself either he died or he led people into battle and what did you do you ran away you left you hid you marched with a flag because you were afraid excuse my language you feared for your own damned hide and when we ask you you tell us that you got confused and you ask me what you could have done that s right i told him the city party committee got confused all the party committees got confused the police got confused baku got confused they all lay in a faint for two weeks and the gang ran the show with impunity and if it weren t for the troops it wouldn t have been just two days there wouldn t be a single armenian left in sumgait for sure they would have finished their bloody affair because they brazenly went up to some russians too the ones who tried to say something to them and they told them as soon as we finish with the armenians we ll come after you too and by the way there was a colonel who took us to the military unit he was the one with the light blue collar tabs who flew in and two hours later arrived on an armored personnel carrier when we were at the sk and took us to the military unit and who later started moving us from the military unit we asked him what how what will come of us he openly said you know for us the main thing now is to catch that gang we ll finish that quickly you ll stay at the military unit for the time being and we ll decide later the general procuracy of the ussr arrived it consists of investigators from all cities there were some from stavropol from everywhere just everywhere because the affair was truly frightful about this by the way comrade katusev spoke as everyone knows he s the first deputy general procurator of the ussr when he gave us a speech from the armored personnel carrier at the military unit by the way he told us the honest truth because he couldn t not say it because he was still experiencing his first impressions of what he had seen and he said there was afghanistan and it was bad but sumgait it s horrible and the people who dared to do such a thing will be severely punished in accordance with our laws and that s a quote then one mother throws herself at him her two sons had died before her very eyes and says who will return my sons who is going to punish the culprits they tried to calm her down and he said in order for us to conduct a proper investigation in order that not a single scoundrel avoid responsibility you must help us because we don t know maybe there was someone else in the gang who is now being concealed in homes and maybe the neighbors know maybe someone saw something don t be afraid write about it in detail so that you re not afraid everyone knows that many of you are afraid having lived through such horrors they think that if they write the whole truth about let s say their neighbor or someone else that they will seek revenge later we re going to do it like this we re going to set up an urn and you can throw what you write in there we don t need to know who wrote it the names of the people who write won t be made public but we need all the information let each and every one not be afraid let each write what is necessary who they saw in that gang who made threats or shouted threatening gibes about the armenians you must describe all of these people and put the information into the urn two soldiers and a major guarded the urn and sure enough many people people who didn t even want to write i know one woman who asked me she came up and said you as a russian the same thing won t happen to you as will happen to me so please i ll give you the information and you please write it down for me so she was afraid and there were a lot like her but later after katusev made his speech she sat and wrote down everything she knew and we threw it all into the urn now we don t know if it will be of any use for a factual picture will emerge from all that information one person can lie but thousands can t lie thousands simply can t lie you have to agree with that a fact is a fact why for example should someone say that black is white if it is really black the first deputy chairman of the council of ministers of the azerbaijani ssr mamedov as i said was in yerevan my husband and i were at the council of ministers of the armenian ssr and found out that mamedov was present the one who had come to convince the people of sumgait to return to their previous dwellings to their old apartments we asked for a meeting with him and it was granted when we went to see him he tried to behave properly very politely delicately but when the truth was told right to his face and when i asked him some of the same questions i had asked muslimzade where were you personally when they were beating us now you re trying to convince us to return why didn t you think at the time that they were slaughtering us where it was all leading he says you re telling the truth let s not mince words you ve told me right to my face and i ll tell you straight i ll tell you the pure truth i was gotten out of bed in the evening the whole government was up including me and we were restraining a crowd of about in baku but we never expected that in a city like sumgait with its fine international record such a thing could happen we expected it in baku i say so that means you expected it all the same why were you expecting it and he says you know it just happened that way we were expecting it in baku we were trying to restrain it but in sumgait i say fine you didn t know for the first three or four hours but then you should have known why did no one help us and he says well ok we didn t know what to do and things like that basically it was the same story i got from muslimzade later when he said you go on back the situation in sumgait is favorable now everything is fine the armenians are friendly with the azerbaijanis to this l answered you know what i m speaking with you as a member of a neutral nation i have never argued with armenians or with azerbaijanis and i was an eyewitness you tell me please comrade mamedov i asked him what would you say about this honestly if you were being completely frank with us then he said yes i admit that i am honestly ashamed shame on the entire azerbaijani nation we have disgraced ourselves not only before the entire soviet union but before the whole world because now the voice of america and all the other foreign radio stations of various hues are branding us with all kinds of rumors too and i say there s nothing to add to what really happened i don t think it s possible to add anything more awful he says yes i agree with you i understand your pain it is truly an unfortunate occurrence i repeat that he said unfortunate occurrence and then he suddenly remembered himself what he was saying he had a pen in his hands he was fidgeting with it nervously and said oh excuse me a tragedy really i take this to mean that he really thinks it s an unfortunate occurrence and of course he says i understand that having gone through all this you can t return to sumgait but it s necessary to cool down and realize that all those people are being tried and he even gave a detail which i don t know if it matters or not that policemen were being tried specifically in relation to that bloody affair yes by the way there is another good detail how i was set up at work in baku after the events i went to an undergarment plant there was an azerbaijani working there and suddenly she tells me what they didn t nail your husband they screwed up i was floored i hadn t imagined that anyone in baku too could say something like that well after that i went up to see to my office i needed to find out about those days what was going to happen with them how they were going to put down those days from february to march and the administrator told me i don t know tatyana go to the head of the conductors pool be grateful if they don t put it down as unexcused absence i was really discouraged by this they all know that we were but a hair away from death and barely survived and here they re telling me that i was skipping work as though i was off enjoying myself somewhere i went to the office of the chief of the pool his last name is rasulov and he s had that position for many years incidentally he s a party member and is a big man in town and suddenly when i went to him and said comrade rasulov this is the way it was he looked at me askance and said and why are you he knows me by my previous last name why did you get wrapped up in this mess i say what do you mean why did i get wrapped up in this mess my husband s an armenian i tell him i have an armenian last name and he screwed up his face made a kind of a grimace as though he had eaten something sour and said i didn t expect that you would what did he mean by that and how should he behave the chief of the pool a man who supervises workers now it s true there was a reduction but for sure there are still conductors working for him and if someone who supervises a staff that size says things like that then what can you expect from a simple uneducated politically unsophisticated person he s going to believe any and all rumors that the armenians are like this the armenians are like that and so on by the way that mamedov now i m going back to mamedov s office when i asked him are you really going to guarantee the safety of our lives if we return to sumgait he answered yes you know i would guarantee them i don t want to take on too much i would guarantee them firmly for years but i won t guarantee them for longer than years i say so you ve got another thing like that planned for years from now so they ll be quiet and then in another years it ll happen again i couldn t contain myself any more and i also told him and how did it get to that point certainly you knew about it how they were treating the russians for example in baku and in sumgait how they were hounded from their jobs certainly you received complaints i wrote some myself why did no one respond to them why did everyone ignore what was going on didn t you prepare people for this by the way you treated them and he says you know you re finally starting to insult me he threw his pen on the desk maybe now you ll say i m a scoundrel too i say you know i m not talking about you because i don t know but about the ones who i do know i can say with conviction yes that comrade was involved in this that and that because i know for certain well anyway he assured us that here in yerevan there were false rumors that sumgait armenians were here and were in sumgait and had gotten back to work everyone was working he said and life was very good we drove about the town ourselves comrade arutiunian first secretary of the communist party of armenia ssr came from the council of ministers of armenian he came and brought information showing that everything was fine in sumgait when i asked mamedov how he had reached that conclusion he said well i walked down the street and i said walking down the street in any city even if i were to go to new york i would never understand the situation because i would be a guest i don t have any contact with people but if you spend days among some blue collar workers in such a way that they didn t know you were the first deputy chairman of the council of ministers you d hear something quite different i told him for example that i drew my conclusion when we left the military unit to look at our apartments they took us all in turns to pick things up since people had fled to the military unit they got on the bus just to save themselves as soon as possible how are the neighbors in the microdistrict how will they view us what do they think i thought maybe that in fact it wasn t something general of a mass nature some anti national something and when that bus took us to our building because it was the same bus while we were going up to our apartment an armed soldier accompanied us what does that say it speaks of the fact that if everything there were fine why do we need to have soldiers go there and come back with us going from apartment to apartment and in fact especially with the young people you could sense the delight at our misfortune the grins and they were making comments too and that was in the presence of troops when police detachments were in the microdistricts and armored personnel carriers and tanks were passing by and if people are taking such malicious delight when the situation is like that then what is it going to be like when they withdraw protection from the city altogether there will be more outrages of course perhaps not organized but in the alleys april

4725###talk.politics.mideast###seventh century a d armenian math problems from quantum magazine march april pages the problem book of anania of shirak on the ancient peak of ararat the centuries have come like seconds and passed on avetik issahakian by yuri danilov some years ago journalists interviewing celebrities liked to ask them what books would you take with you if you were to go off on a space flight and though the number of books allowed on the trip varied from to depending on the type of spacecraft and the generosity of the interviewer and celebrities are people of the most varied tastes ages and professions not one of them dared to say that he or she would want to take with them at least one book of arithmetic problems some of these people certainly excluded this kind of literature because they were trained in the humanities and had nothing but scorn for numbers though secretly afraid of them others steered clear of such puzzle books because they were masters of incomparably more difficult branches of modern mathematics and didn t mind saying for all the world to hear that they didn t know how to solve mere arithmetic problems professional mathematicians were no exception here s what the russian mathematician alexander khinchin a specialist in statistics wrote about arithmetic i willingly confess that any time a fifth grader asked me to help solve an arithmetic problem it was a hard work for me and sometimes i failed completely of course like most of my friends i could easily solve the problem by the natural algebraic route constructing equations or sets of equations but we were supposed to avoid using algebraic analysis at all costs by the way it s a fact that is well known and oft repeated that as a rule neither high school graduates nor students at teaching colleges nor teachers beginning their careers nor i must add scientific researchers can solve arithmetic problems it seems the only people in the world who are able to solve them are fifth grade teachers now i m not insisting that a book of arithmetic problems be included in the bookbag of anyone flying into space but a sense of justice induces me to recommend one particular problem book one that will satisfy the most fastidious taste and supply food for thought sufficient not only for a relatively short flight to the moon but for a extended space voyage say to venus and back one for the road they both took out the books they brought for the road kingsley glanced at the royal astronomer s book and saw a bright cover with a group of cutthroats shooting at each other with revolvers god knows what this kind of stuff leads to thought kingsley the royal astronomer looked at kingsley s book and saw the history of herodotus good lord next he ll be reading thucydides thought the royal astronomer fred hoyle the black cloud the book i m talking about isn t very big but its problems constitute elegant miniatures from seventh century armenia naive and wise at the same time rich in striking detail and the bright coloration of the period these problems are reminiscent of the reliefs on the famous monument of armenian architecture the church on the island of akhtamar in lake van in what is now turkey they are as inseparable from the image of armenia as the elegant letters of the armenian alphabet invented by mesrop mashtots or the songs of komitas or the paintings of saryan an edition of these incredibly beautiful problems has long been a bibliographic rarity it was published under the title problems and solutions of vardapet anania of shirak armenian mathematician of the seventh century translated and published by i a orbeli petrograd the abundance of close observations and wide ranging information about the way of life and customs of that remote epoch when anania of shirak lived and worked have actually rendered a disservice to his problem book for many years the book was known only to researchers in the humanities specialists in armenian history who jealously guarded their treasure and wouldn t let just anyone see it even now after research by k p patkanov the learned monk father kaloust j i orbeli a abramyan v k chaloyan and others has brought the works of anania of shirak to light in scholarly circles the general reader remains ignorant of the very existence of this remarkable problem book vardapet anania of shirak once fell in love with the art of calculation i thought that no philosophical notion can be constructed without number considering it the mother of all wisdom anania of shirak among ancient armenian thinkers vardapet anania of shirak stands out because of the breadth of his interests and the unique mathematical orientation of his work some of his works have been preserved in addition to the problems and solutions the following tracts have found a special place in the estimation of scholars on weights and measures cosmography and calendrical theory and armenian geography of the seventh century a d the authorship of the last work was long attributed to another outstanding thinker of ancient armenia movses of khoren in his autobiography anania of shirak has this to say about himself i anania of shirak having studied all the science of our armenian land and having learned the holy scripture intimately in the expression of the psalmist every day i illuminated the eyes of my mind feeling myself lacking in the art of calculation i came to the conclusion that it is fruitless to study philosophy the mother of all sciences without number i could find in armenia neither a man versed in philosophy nor books that explained the sciences i therefore went to greece and met in theodosiople a man named iliazar who was well versed in ecclesiastical works he told me that in forth armenia there lived a famous mathematician christosatur i went this person and spent six months with him but soon i noticed that christosatur was a master not of all science but only of certain fragmentary facts i then went to constantinople where i met acquaintances who told me why did you go so far when much closer to us in trebizon on the coast of pontus lives the byzantine vardapet tyukhik he is full of wisdom is known to kings and knows armenian literature i asked them how they knew this they answered we saw ourselves that many people traveled long distances to become pupils of so learned a man indeed the archdeacon of the patriarchate of constantinople philagrus traveled with us bringing many young persons to become pupils of tyukhik when i heard this i expressed my gratitude to god who had quenched the thirst of his slave i went to tyukhik at the monastery of st eugene and explained why i had come he received me graciously and said i praise our lord that he sent you to learn and to transplant science in the domain of st gregory i am glad that all your country will learn from me i myself lived in armenia for many years as a youth ignorance reigned there vardapet tyukhik loved me as a son and shared all his thoughts with me the lord bestowed upon me his blessing i completely assimilated the science of number and with such success that my fellow students at the king s court began to envy me i spent eight years with tyukhik and studied many books that had not been translated into our language for the vardapet had an innumerable collection of books secret and explicit ecclesiastical and pagan books on art history and medicine books of chronologies why enumerate them by title in a word there is no book that tyukhik did not have and he had such a gift from the holy spirit for translating that when he sat down to translate something from the greek into armenian he did not struggle as other translators did and the translation read as if the work were written in that language originally tyukhik told me how he had achieved such vast erudition and how he had learned the armenian language when i was young he said i lived in trebizon at the court of the military chief ioannus patricus and for a long time up to the accession of mauritius to the throne i served as a military man in armenia and learned your language and literature during one attack by persian troops on the greeks i was wounded and escaped to antioch i lost all my possessions praying to the lord to heal my wounds i made a promise if you prolong my life i shall dedicate it not to accumulating perishable treasures but to collecting treasures of knowledge and the lord heard my prayers after i recovered i went to jerusalem and from there to alexandria and rome upon returning to constantinople i met a famous philosopher from athens and studied with him for many years after that i returned to my homeland and began to teach and instruct my people after some years that philosopher died not finding a replacement for him the king and his courtiers sent for tyukhik and invited him to assume the teacher s position tyukhik citing the promise he made to god not to move far from the city turned down the offer but because of his wide leaning people came streaming from all countries to study with him and i the most insignificant of all armenians having learned from him this powerful science desired by kings brought it to our country supported by no one obligated only to my own industry god s help and the prayers of the blessed educator and no one thanked me for my efforts problems and solutions a half and one sixth and one nine ninth of all the books were printed on verge one fifth and one two hundred eighty fifth on rag paper one forty fifth and one eight hundred fifty fifth on vellum and forty five inscribed copies on dutch paper and so find how many copies were printed in all imitation of anania of shirak a latin proverb says habent sua fata libelli books have their own fate the fate of problems and solutions by anania of shirak is quite amazing the manuscripts of anania s book were preserved only because according to armenian historians in ancient and medieval armenia manuscripts were guarded from invaders like weapons and cherished like one s own children biding their time the manuscripts lay in the matenadaran a renowned depository of ancient manuscripts now the mesrop mashtots institute of ancient manuscripts and its hour finally arrived in the learned monk father kaloust used two manuscripts to publish the problem book supplementing it with an introduction and commentary in the book was translated into russian edited annotated and typeset by iosef orbeli a prominent scholar and later a member of the academy of sciences of the ussr in the translator s words the problems of anania are amusing full of life and simple orbeli goes on to say the subjects of the problems are generally taken from everyday life the scene is predominantly his homeland shirak and the surrounding countryside and the dramatis personae if they are named are the local princes the kamsarakans including nersekh who was a contemporary of anania like other ancient authors anania of shirak used only aliquots that is fractions with a numerator of when it is necessary to write fractions with numerators other than one has to represent it as a sum of aliquots see the epigraph above like any true work of art the problems of anania suffer terribly in the retelling you have to read the originals albeit in translation in their full glory so let s open anania s problem book a gift from across the ages problems and relate to the armenian uprising against the persians in a d problem my father told me the following story during the famous wars between the armenians and the persians prince zaurak kamsarakan performed extraordinary heroic deeds three times in a single month he attacked the persian troops the first time he struck down half of the persian army the second time pursuing the persians he slaughtered one fourth of the soldiers the third time he destroyed one eleventh of the persian army the persians who were still alive numbering two hundred eighty fled to nakhichevan and so from this remainder find how many persian soldiers there were before the massacre problem during the famous armenian uprising against the persians when zaurak kamsarakan killed suren one of the armenian azats sent an envoy to the persian king to report the baleful news the envoy covered fifty miles in a day fifteen days later when he learned of this zaurak kamsarakan sent riders in pursuit to bring the envoy back the riders covered eighty miles in a day and so find how many days it took them to catch the envoy problem mentions vessels made of varying amounts of metal in the russian translation they are all called dishes but in the original armenian according to orbeli s note the dishes in the first and second instances are called mesur and in the third instance scutel scutel is a common armenian word but mesur had not been encountered in armenian literature before anania s problems and solutions problem there was a tray in my house i melted it down and made other vessels from the metal from one third i made a mesur from one fourth another mesur from one fifth two goblets from one sixth two scutels and from two hundred ten drams i made a bowl and now find the weight of the tray several of the problems reflect the richness of the caucasian fauna in anania s time for instance problem problem once i was in marmet the capital of the kamsarakans strolling along the bank of the river akhuryan i saw a school of fish and ordered that a net be cast we caught a half and a quarter of the school and all the fishes that slipped out of the net ended up in a creel when i looked in the creel i found forty five fishes and now find how many fishes here were in all the temptation is great to present all problems but i ll restrain myself and offer you just one more problem provides some interesting information about the wild animals that inhabited armenia at one time but now extinct for so long that there is no mention of them even in zoological reference books the wild donkey according to the generally accepted view never roamed the armenian lands yet anania of shirak offers evidence to the contrary problem the hunting preserve of nersekh kamsarakan ter of shirak and asharunik was at the base of the mountain called artin one night great herds of wild donkey entered the preserve the hunters could not cope with the donkeys and running to the village of talin told nersekh about them when he arrived with his brothers and azats and entered the preserve they began killing the wild beasts half of the animals were caught in traps one fourth were killed by arrows the young which constituted one twelfth of all the animals were caught alive and three hundred sixty wild donkeys were killed by spears and so find how many beasts there were at the start of this massacre set in type by me iosef orbeli his biography could not be squeezed into the framework of a bibliography k uzbashyan academician iosef abgarovich orbeli anyone who is lucky enough to hold a copy n of the small printing n is the solution to the epigraph in the previous section of the russian translation of anania of shirak s problems and solutions a thin book with yellowed pages has probably noticed the variety of the fonts the elegance of the borders and the high quality of the design printing and binding such great attention to detail is characteristic of works that fulfill a requirement for a degree in bookmaking and this problem book was indeed a kind of diploma attesting to the professional maturity of the man who created it an advertisement at the end of the book reads this book was typeset in december at the printing offices of the russian academy of sciences by me iosef orbeli the text was also proofread laid out and decorated with borders by me various circumstances prevented me from carrying this project to the end the final pages of the book were typeset by m strolman typesetting was neither the first nor the only profession of the renowned orientalist iosef orbeli who later became the director of the hermitage museum in leningrad he was also a cabinetmaker and a locksmith orbeli had already become acquainted with the famous academic printing house typis academiae founded in and known all over the scientific world for its rich collection of fonts and its virtuoso typesetters in preparing to publish the corpus of ancient inscriptions preserved on the walls of armenian churches orbeli found it necessary to create a new font that would preserve the unique signs and ligatures this complicated work was done by m g strolman unfortunately the entire set of letters was destroyed during the blockade of leningrad in world war ii when orbeli came to the printing offices of the academy of sciences times were hard the only way to publish the newly translated problems of anania was for orbeli to learn typesetting he had always been attracted to the printer s craft in orbeli became the director of printing at the academy of sciences even after he retired he remained a tireless champion of russian academic typography back to earth this book by definition does not exhaust all the most important works in this domain the editor hopes that those who are guilty of this incompleteness will read these lines and stung by shame will work up if not a collection like this at least a monograph v bonch bruyevich introduction to the russian translation of solid body symmetry by r knox and a gold let s imagine a time when space flight is an everyday thing and high schoolers will spend their breaks as astronauts in training in the perelman crater on the far side of the moon maybe one of the space travelers will take this very copy of quantum and another looking over her shoulder will read this article and say to himself this anania from shirak seems like a pretty interesting guy when i get home i ll try to find his problems good luck my young friend anania is sure to entertain you perhaps by then there will be more than n copies of his timeless problems and solutions and we can hope they will be as lovingly printed as the masterpieces created by iosef orbeli vardapet or vartabed means teacher or learned man in armenian the armenian language suffers in english from a dual transliteration scheme thus mesrop is often rendered as mesrob komitas as gomidas and so on fourth armenia was one of fifteen provinces into which according to armenian geography in the seventh century a d so called great armenia was divided pontus or pontus euxinus was an old name for the black sea azats were members one of several strata of freemen in ancient armenia ter was the title of the heads of sovereign royal families in ancient armenia

away with attacking another is to use an innocent as a shield and hope that the other respects innocent lives tell me tim what are these guerillas doing wrong assuming that they are using civilians for cover assuming also come on brad if we are going to get anywhere in this or any discussion it doesn t help to bring up elements i never addressed nor commented on in any way i made no comment on who is right or who is wrong only that civilians are being used as cover and that having been placed in between the israelis and the guerillas they will be injured as both parties continue their fight pardon me tim but i do not see how it can be possible for the idf to fail to detect the presence of those responsible for planting the bomb which killed the three idf troops and then later know the exact number and whereabouts of all of them several villages were shelled how could the idf possibly have known that there were guerrillas in each of the targetted villages you see it was an arbitrary act of retaliation if the buffer zone is to prevent attacks on israel is it not working why is it further neccessary for israeli guns to pound lebanese villages why not just kill those who try to infiltrate the buffer zone you see there is more to the shelling of the villages it is called retaliation getting back getting even it doesn t make sense to shell the villages the least it shows is a reckless disregard by the israeli government for the lives of civilians i agree with you here i have always thought that israel s bombing sortees and bombing policy is stupid thoughtless inhumane and ineffective but there is no reason that israel should passive wait until attackers chose to act there is every reason to believe that taking the fight to the enemy will do more to stop attacks as i said previously israel spent several decades sitting passively on its side of a border and only acting to stop these attacks after the attackers had entered israeli territory it didn t work very well the host arab state did little nothing to try and stop these attacks from its side of the border with israel so the number of attacks were considerably higher as was their physical and psychological impact on the civilians caught in their path the problem tim is that the original reason for the invasion was palestinian attacks on israel not lebanese attacks what so the whole bit about attacks on israel from neighboring arab states can start all over again while i also hope for this to happen it will only occur when arab states show that they are prepared to take on the responsibility and the duty to stop guerilla attacks on israel from their soil they have to prove it or provide some guaratees there is no way israel is going to accept their word not with their past attitude of tolerance towards anti israel guerillas in residence if israel is not willing to accept the word of others then imho it has no business wasting others time coming to the peace talks this is just another selectively applied statement the reason for this drawn out impasse between ababs palestinians and israelis is that neither side is willing to accept the word of the other by your criteria everyone should stay away from the negotiations that is precisely why the palestinians in their recent pisga proposal for the interim period after negotiations and leading up to full autonomy are demanding conditions that essentially define autonomy already they do not trust that israel will follow through the entire process and allow palestinians to reach full autonomy do you understand and accept this viewpoint by the palestinians if you do then why should israel s view of arabs palestinians be any different why should they trust the arab palestinians words since they don t they are very reluctant to give up tangible assets land control of areas in exchange for words for this reason they are also concerned about the sorts of guarantees they will have that the arabs will follow through on their part of any agreement reached first i believe that my statement applies to both sides having said that i think it is neccessary to separate what is legitimately negotiable and what is not for example no country has the right to abuse one s human rights deciding whether there will be one or two states in palestine is a legitimate question while de facto one state exists israel must treat all within its domain equitably tim you are ignoring the fact that the palestinians in lebanon have been disarmed hezbollah remains the only independent militia hezbollah does not attack israel except at a few times such as when the idf burned up sheikh mosavi his wife and young son while the major armaments those allowing people to wage civil wars have been removed the weapons needed to cross border attacks still remain to some extent rocket attacks still continue and commando raids only require a few easily concealed weapons and a refined disregard for human life yours of that of others such attacks also continue yes i am afraid that what you say is true but that still does not justify occupying your neighbor s land israel must resolve its disputes with the native palestinians if it wants peace from such attacks of course if israel would withdraw from lebanon and stop assassinating people and shelling villages they wouldn t make the lebanese so mad as to do that bat guano the situation you call for existed in the s and attacks were commonplace not true lebanese were not attacking israel in the s with a strong lebanese government free from syrian and israeli interference i believe that the border could be adequately patrolled the palestinian heavy weapons have been siezed in past years and i do not see as significant a threat as once existed please tim don t fall into the trap of treating lebanese and palestinians as all part of the same group there are too many who think all arabs or all muslims are the same too many times i have seen people support the bombing of palestinian camps in retaliation for an idf death at the hands of the lebanese resistance or the shelling of lebanese villages in retaliation for a palestinian attack tim

no acting commander of erzurum and deveboynu regions and commander of the second erzurum artillery regiment prisoner of war lieutenant colonel toverdodleyov the things i have heard and seen during the two months until the liberation of erzurum by the turks have surpassed all the allegations concerning the vicious degenerate characteristic of the armenians during the russian occupation of erzurum no armenian was permitted to approach the city and its environs while the commander of the first army corps general kaltiyin remained in power troops including armenian enlisted men were not sent to the area when the security measures were lifted the armenians began to attack erzurum and its surroundings following the attacks came the plundering of the houses in the city and the villages and the murder of the owners of these houses plundering was widely committed by the soldiers this plunder was mainly committed by armenian soldiers who had remained in the rear during the war one day while passing through the streets on horseback a group of soldiers including an armenian soldier began to drag two old men of seventy years in a certain direction the roads were covered with mud and these people were dragging the two helpless turks through the mud and dirt it was understood later that all these were nothing but tricks and traps the turks who joined the gendarmarie soon changed their minds and withdrew the reason was that most of the turks who were on night patrol did not return and no one knew what had happened to them the turks who had been sent outside the city for labour began to disappear also finally the court martial which had been established for the trials of murderers and plunderers began to liquidate itself for fear that they themselves would be punished the incidents of murder and rape which had decreased began to occur more frequently sometime in january and february a leading turkish citizen haci bekir efendi from erzurum was killed one night at his home the commander in chief odiselidge gave orders to find murderers within three days the commander in chief has bitterly reminded the armenian intellectuals that disobedience among the armenian enlisted men had reached its highest point that they had insulted and robbed the people and half of the turks sent outside the city had not returned we learnt the details this incident from the commander in chief odishelidge they were as follows the killings were organized by the doctors and the employers and the act of killing was committed solely by the armenian renegades more than eight hundred unarmed and defenceless turks have been killed in erzincan large holes were dug and the defenceless turks were slaughtered like animals next to the holes later the murdered turks were thrown into the holes the armenian who stood near the hole would say when the hole was filled with the corpses seventy dead bodies well this hole can take ten more thus ten more turks would be cut into pieces thrown into the hole and when the hole was full it would be covered over with soil the armenians responsible for the act of murdering would frequently fill a house with eighty turks and cut their heads off one by one following the erzincan massacre the armenians began to withdraw towards erzurum the armenian renegades among those who withdrew to erzurum from erzincan raided the moslem villages on the road and destroyed the entire population together with the villages during the transportation of the cannons ammunition and the carriages that were outside the war area certain people were hired among the kurdish population to conduct the horse carriages while the travellers were passing through erzurum the armenians took advantage of the time when the russian soldiers were in their dwellings and began to kill the kurds they had hired when the russian soldiers heard the cries of the dying kurds they attempted to help them however the armenians threatened the russian soldiers by vowing that they would have the same fate if they intervened and thus prevented them from acting all these terrifying acts of slaughter were committed with hatred and loathing lieutenant medivani from the russian army described an incident that he witnessed in erzurum as follows an armenian had shot a kurd the kurd fell down but did not die the armenian attempted to force the stick in his hand into the mouth of the dying kurd however since the kurd had firmly closed his jaws in his agony the armenian failed in his attempt having seen this the armenian ripped open the abdomen of the kurd disembowelled him and finally killed him by stamping him with the iron heel of his boot odishelidge himself told us that all the turks who could not escape from the village of ilica were killed their heads had been cut off by axes he also told us that he had seen thousands of murdered children lieutenant colonel gryaznov who passed through the village of ilica three weeks after the massacre told us the following there were thousands of dead bodies hacked to pieces on the roads every armenian who happened to pass through these roads cursed and spat on the corpses in the courtyard of a mosque which was about x meter square dead bodies were piled to a height of centimeters among these corpses were men and women of every age children and old people the women s bodies had obvious marks of rape the genitals of many girls were filled with gun powder a few educated armenian girls who worked as telephone operators for the armenian troops were called by lieutenant colonel gryaznov to the courtyard of the mosque and he bitterly told them to be proud of what the armenians had done to the lieutenant colonel s disgusted amazement the armenian girls started to laugh and giggle instead of being horrified the lieutenant colonel had severely reprimanded those girls for their indecent behaviour when he told the girls that the armenians including women were generally more licentious than even the wildest animals and that their indecent and shameful laughter was the most obvious evidence of their inhumanity and barbarity before a scene that appalled even veteran soldiers the armenian girls finally remembered their sense of shame and claimed they had laughed because they were nervous an armenian contractor at the alaca communication zone command narrated the following incident which took place on february the armenians had nailed a turkish women to the wall they had cut out the women s heart and placed the heart on top of her head the great massacre in erzurum began on february the enlisted men of the artillery division caught and stripped people then they took these people into the bath to satisfy their lusts people among this group were able to save their lives as the result of my decisive attempts the others the armenians claimed were released when they learnt that i understood what was going on among those who organized this treacherous act was the envoy to the armenian officers karagodaviev today some turks were murdered on the streets on february some armenians have shot more than ten innocent moslems the russian soldiers who attempted to save these people were threatened with death meanwhile i imprisoned an armenian for murdering an innocent turk when an armenian officer told an armenian murderer that he would be hanged for his crime the killer shouted furiously how dare you hang an armenian for killing a turk in erzurum the armenians burned down the turkish market on february i heard that the entire population of tepekoy village situated within the artillery area had been totally annihilated on the same day when antranik entered erzurum i reported the massacre to him and asked him to track down the perpetrators of this horrible act however no result was achieved in the villages whose inhabitants had been massacred there was a natural silence on the night of february the armenians deceived the russians perpetrated a massacre and escaped for fear of the turkish soldiers later it was understood that this massacre had been based upon a method organized and planned in a circular the population had been herded in a certain place and then killed one by one the number of murders committed on that night reached three thousand it was the armenians who bragged to about the details of the massacre the armenians fighting against the turkish soldiers were so few in number and so cowardly that they could not even withstand the turkish soldiers who consisted of only five hundred people and two cannons for one night and ran away the leading armenians of the community could have prevented this massacre however the armenian intellectuals had shared the same ideas with the renegades in this massacre just as in all the others the lower classes within the armenian community have always obeyed the orders of the leading armenian figures and commanders i do not like to give the impression that all armenian intellectuals were accessories to these murders no for there were people who opposed the armenians for such actions since they understood that it would yield no result however such people were only a minority furthermore such people were considered as traitors to the armenian cause some have seemingly opposed the armenian murders but have supported the massacres secretly some on the other hand preferred to remain silent there were certain others who when accused by the russians of infamy would say the following you are russians you can never understand the armenian cause the armenians had a conscience they would commit massacres and then would flee in fear of the turkish soldiers serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks and then proceeded

x soviet armenia the following letter which represents a small portion of the full text along with more than pages of historical documents scholarly sources eyewitness accounts and photographs was sent to president bill clinton members of congress editors program directors and columnists of major newspapers journals and radio tv stations for the th anniversary of the armenian genocide of million muslim people on april of every year the people of turkiye remember their dead they grieve for lost family and the lost homes of their grandfathers this year the turkish nation is mourning and praying again for her fallen heroes who gave their lives generously and with altruism so that the future generations may live on that anointed soil of the turkish land happily and prosperously letter during the years of world war i the x soviet armenian government has planned and perpetrated the genocide of the muslim people which not only took the lives of million muslim people but was also the method used to empty the turkish homeland of its inhabitants to this day turkish historic lands remain occupied by the x soviet armenia in order to cover up the fact of its usurpation of the historic turkish homeland which is the crux of turkish political demands fascist x soviet armenia continues its anti turkish policy in the following ways x soviet armenia denies the historical fact of the turkish genocide in order to shift international public opinion away from its political responsibility x soviet armenia employing asala sdpa arf terrorism and revisionism triangle attempts to call into question the veracity of the turkish genocide x soviet armenia has also implemented state sponsored terrorism through the asala sdpa arf terrorism and revisionism triangle in an attempt to silence the turkish people s vehement demands and protests using all its human financial and governmental resources x soviet armenia and its tools in the united states attempt to silence through terrorism bribery and other subversive methods non turkish supporters of the turkish cause be they political governmental and humanitarian using all the aforementioned methods the x soviet armenian government is attempting to neutralize the international diplomatic community from making the turkish case a contemporary issue yet despite the efforts of the x soviet armenian government and its terrorist and revisionist organizations in the last decades thanks to the struggle of those whose closest ones have been systematically exterminated by the armenians the international wall of silence on this issue has begun to collapse and consequently a number of governments and organizations have become supportive of the recognition of the turkish genocide with the full knowledge that the struggle for the turkish territorial demands are still in their initial stages the turkish and kurdish people will unflaggingly continue in this sacred struggle therefore the victims of the turkish genocide demand that the x soviet armenian government as the heirs of the armenian dictatorship recognize the turkish genocide that x soviet armenia return the historic homeland to the turkish and kurdish people that the x soviet armenian government make material reparations for their heinous and unspeakable crime to the victims of the turkish genocide that all world governments and especially the united states officially recognize the turkish genocide and turkish territorial rights and refuse to succumb to all armenian political pressure that the u s government free itself from the friendly position it has adopted towards its unreliable ally x soviet armenia and officially recognize the historical fact of the turkish genocide as well as be supportive of the pursuit of turkish territorial demands that the x soviet republics officially recognize the historical fact of the turkish genocide and include the cold blooded extermination of million muslim people in their history books the awareness of the turkish people of the necessity of solidarity in the efforts to pursue the turkish cause is seen by the victims of the first genocide of the th century as a positive step furthermore a new generation has risen equipped with a deep sense of commitment politically mature and conscious who determinedly pursue the turkish cause through all necessary means ranging from the political and diplomatic to the armed struggle therefore the victims of the turkish genocide call upon all muslims in the united states and canada to participate vigorously in the political cultural and religious activities of the th anniversary of the armenian genocide of million muslim people serdar argic we closed the roads and mountain passes that might serve as ways of escape for the turks

questions to israelis to shaig think com subject ten questions to israelis dear shai in the answer to my first question concerning the nonexistence of israeli nationality your answer conflicts with information i have received from other quarters according to which there are two distinct categories of classifying israelis citizenship ezrahut and nationality le um the former is used on passports etc and the later for daily identification in israeli society i am told that people in israel have to carry their id cards at all times and present them at many public places almost every day these id cards make clear who the holder is a jew or an arab you maintain that this mainly because of religious services provided but do you really believe that this is the reason could you provide evidence that this is the case and that it serves no other purpose a number of points you are making assumptions about the manner in which the cards are used true by law all residents citizens and tourists must carry a form of identification with them for citizens the standard id is the id card the purpose this serves on a daily basis wherein they are presented at public places is for the purpose of identifying the bearer this takes place in banks cashing checks post offices registered mail and such etc quite frankly it was rare that i ever had to present my id card for such activities more than once per week there is no law or requirement that forces people to wave their id cards in public furthermore none of the services i outlined discriminate against the bearer in any manner by having access to this information the only case that i can think of in which the le um field might be taken into account is during interaction with the police based upon the scenario in general though arab citizens are clearly recognizable as are non arabs your argument therefore becomes moot unless you can provide an example of how this field is being used to discriminate against them officially in the answer to my second questions concerning the fact that israel has no fixed borders you state that israel s borders were shaped and reshaped by both war and peace according to what i read the first zionists in the beginning of the century had plans for the jewish state to extend into what is lebanon and into transjordan jordan i also read that it was the express wish of ben gurion to not declare israel s borders when israel was established as this might restrict israel s opportunities for later expansion israel often claims it right of existence on the fact that jews lived there years ago or that god promised the land to them but according to biblical sources the area god promised would extend all the way to iraq and what were the borders in biblical times which israel considers proper to use today finally if israel wants peace why can t it declare what it considers its legitimate and secure borders which might be a base for negotiations having all the above facts in mind one cannot blame arab countries to fear israeli expansionism as a number of wars have proved i take issue with your assertions i think that arab countries do know that they have nothing to fear from israeli expansionism militarily israel is not capable of holding onto large tracts of land under occupation to a hostile armed and insurgent population for a sustained period of time as is the intifada is heavily taxing the israeli economy proof of this can be seen in the israeli withdrawal from lebanon israeli troops pulled back from the awali and later from the litani in order to control the minimal strip needed to keep towns out of range of katyusha missile fire public opinion in israel has turned towards settling the intifada via territorial concessions the israel public is sufferring from battle fatigue of sorts and the gov t is aware of it with regards to borders let me state the following i may not agree with the manner in which negotiations are being held however the crux of the matter is that everyone either makes or refrains from stating a starting position the arab parties have called for total withdrawal and a return to pre borders if israel were to state large borders the negotiations might never get under way if israel were to state smaller borders then the arab countries might try and force even smaller borders during the negotiations i think that leaving the matter to be settled by negotiations and peace treaties is infinitely more realistic and sensible your answer to my third question is typical of a stalinist public official i don t think your answer is honest you refer me to vanunu s revelations about israel s nuclear arsenal without evaluating the truthfullness of his revelations now if he said the truth then why should he been punished and if he lied why should he be punished i would appreciate more honesty your statement is typical of the simple minded naivety of a center for policy research whether or not all of vanunu s revelations were true has no bearing on the fact that some were for disclosing state secrets after having signed contracts and forms with the understanding that said secrets are not to be made public one should be punished as to which were and which weren t i am under no moral obligation to disclose that quite the reverse in fact he was taken to court tried and found guilty you may take issue with a number of things but clearly you have no understanding of the concept of secrets of state something which every democratic govt has somebody provided an answer to the fourth question concerning hidden prisoners in israeli prisons he posted an article from ma ariv documenting such cases it seems that such prisoners do exist in israel what do you think about that i noticed that he was documenting the fact that such prisoners could exist more than he documented the fact that they do exist the clu noted which you evidently did not pay attention to that they know of no such reports or cases i am sorry to tell you but in a country of mill as tightly knit as israel even if the matter of the arrest was not made public within a relatively short time frame most people would know about it my own feelings are that the matter of the arrest should be made public unless a court order is issued allowing a delay of x hours this would be granted only if a judge could be convinced that an announcement would cause irreparable harm to the ongoing investigation you imply that my questions show bias and are formulated in such a way to cast aspersions upon israel such terms have often been used by the soviet union against dissidents they call the soviet union into disrepute if my questions are not disturbing they would not call forth such hysterical answers my questions are clearly provocative but they are meant to seek facts i would be very happy if you could convince me that what i am told about israel were just fabrications but alas you have failed to do so i suspect that you fear the truth and an open and honest discussion this is a sign of weakness not of strength well i am sorry to say that your questions are slanted such questions are often termed tabloid journalism and are not disturbing because they avoid any attempt at objectivity such questions were often used during the mccarthy era as a basis for the witch hunts that took place then to use your own example these questions might have been lifted from the format used by stalinist prosecutors that were looking for small bits of evidence that they could distort and portray as a larger and dirtier picture my answers were not any more hysterical than the questions themselves the problem is not that the q s were provocative it was that they were selective in their fact seeking you fall into the same category of those who seek yes no answers when the real answer is of sorts i suspect that as long as the answers to these questions is not an unequivocal no you would remain unsatified and choose to interprete them as you see fit a sign of strength is the ability to look you remind me of those mistaken environmentalists who once advocated culling wolves because of the cruelty to deer only to find that they had broken the food chain and wreaked havoc upon the very environment they sought to protect the color blindness you exhibit is a true sign of weakness i hope you will muster the courage to seek the full truth ditto

association on grounds that there are no turks in western thrace such community associations had been active until but they were first told to remove the word turkish on their buildings and on their official papers and then eventually close down this is also the final verdict november of the greek high court in the city of komotini a former greek parliamentarian of turkish parentage was sentenced recently to months of imprisonment with no right to appeal just for saying outloud that he was of turkish descent this duly elected ethnic turkish official was also deprived of his political rights for a period of three years each one of these barbaric acts seems to be none other than a vehicle used by the greek governments to cover up their inferiority complex they display vis a vis the people of turkiye the agreement on the exchange of minorities uses the term turks which demonstrates what is actually meant by the previous reference to muslims the fact that the greek governments also mention the existence of a few thousand non turkish muslims does not change the essential reality that there lives in western thrace a much bigger turkish minority the pomaks are also a muslim people whom all the three nations bulgarians turks and greeks consider as part of themselves do you know how the muslim turkish minority was organized according to the agreements poor poly it also proves that the turkish people are trapped in greece and the greek people are free to settle anywhere in the world the greek authorities deny even the existence of a turkish minority they pursue the same denial in connection with the macedonians of greece talk about oppression in addition in the democratic greek parliament passed law no virtually taking over the administration of the vakiflar and other charitable trusts they have ceased to be self supporting religious and cultural entities talk about fascism the greek governments are attempting to appoint the muftus irrespective of the will of the turkish minority as state official although the orthodox church has full authority in similar matters in greece the muslim turkish minority will have no say in electing its religious leaders talk about democracy the government of greece has recently destroyed an islamic convention in komotini such destruction which reflects an attitude against the muslim turkish cultural heritage is a violation of the lausanne convention as well as the so called greek constitution which is supposed to guarantee the protection of historical monuments the government of greece on the other hand is building new churches in remote villages as a complementary step toward hellenizing the region and you pondered sidiropoulos the president of the macedonian human rights committee became the latest victim of a tactic long used by the greeks to silence critics of policies of forced assimilation of the macedonian minority a forestry official by occupation sidiropoulos has been sent to internal exile on the island of kefalonia hundreds of kilometers away from his native florina his employer the florina city council asked him to depart in hours the greek authorities are trying to punish him for his involvement in copenhagen he returned to florina by his own choice and remains without a job helsinki watch a well known human rights group had been investigating the plight of the turkish minority in greece in august their findings were published in a report titled destroying ethnic identity turks of greece the report confirmed gross violations of the human rights of the turkish minority by the greek authorities it says for instance the greek government recently destroyed an islamic convent in komotini such destruction which reflects an attitude against the muslim turkish cultural heritage is a violation of the lausanne convention the turkish cemeteries in the village of vafeika and in pinarlik were attacked and tombstones were broken the cemetery in karotas was razed by bulldozers shall i go on why not the people of turkiye are not going to take human rights lessons from the greek government the discussion of human rights violations in greece does not stop at the greek frontier in several following articles i shall dwell on and expose the greek treatment of turks in western thrace and the aegean macedonians it has been reported that the greek cypriot administration has an intense desire for arms and that greece has made plans to supply it with the tanks and armored vehicles it has to destroy in accordance with the agreement reached on conventional arms reductions in europe meanwhile greek and greek cypriot officials are reported to have planned to take ostentatious measures aimed at camouflaging the transfer of these tanks and armored vehicles to southern cyprus a process that will conflict with the spirit of the agreement on conventional arms reduction in europe an acceptable method may certainly be found when there is a will but we know of various kinds of violent behaviors ranging from physical attacks to the burning of buildings the rugs at the amfia village mosque were dragged out to the front of the building and burnt there shots

conduct were killed with specially atrocious tortures before the battle the wife of the lawyer enver bey coming from her garden was maltreated by greek soldiers she was even stript of her garments and

burst open with blows from the butt end of a gun during the firing of the town eleven children six little girls and five boys fleeing from the flames were stopped by greek soldiers in the ramazan pacha quarter and thrown into a burning jewish house near bridge where they were burnt alive this fact is confirmed on oath by the retired commandant hussein hussni effendi who saw it the clock maker ahmed effendi and his son sadi were arrested and dragged out of their shop the son had his eyes put out and was then killed in the court of the greek church but ahmed effendi has been no more heard of

you the truelove or falselove of arromdian of the asala sdpa arf terrorism and revisionism triangle if turks had behaved like christians to use force to convert to islam the nations which they brought under their power to which no one could have opposed today there would be no eastern problem but turks did not do so they obeyed the word of the koran to permit everybody to worship in their own way centuries before frederick the great pronounced his famous dictum thus in an age when the christian europe itself shed christian blood and when people in europe enjoyed inflicting inhuman tortures upon those whose beliefs differed from theirs the ottoman empire became the sole country where the inquisition did not exist where deaths at the stake were unheard of and where accusations of witchcraft were not made and the barbarian turkey was the only country where the jews persecuted and chased away everywhere by the christians could find asylum these facts demonstrate that muslim countries provided spiritually far better living conditions than christian countries the turks who are a conquering nation did not turkify the nations that came under their rule instead they respected their religions and traditions it was a stroke of luck for romania to live under turkish rule instead of russian or austrian rule because otherwise there would not have been a romanian nation today popescu ciocanel turks rule over people under their administration only externally without interfering with their internal structures on account of this the autonomy of minorities in turkey is better and more complete than any in the most advanced european countries human beings hate each other on account of religious differences this flaw is older than islam and christianity but there has never been any examples of this adjuration in turkey because turks never oppress anybody on account of his religion if enmity on the basis of religion had been such a case of simple contempt among us too or if it did not keep translating itself into action many nations in our europe would probably have considered themselves happy a de mortraye turkey never became a scene for religious terror or for the cruelty of the inquisition on the contrary it served as an asylum for the unfortunate victims of christian fanaticism if you look into history you will see that in the fifteenth century thousands of jews who were expelled from spain and portugal found such a good asylum in turkey that their descendants have been living there very calmly all through these approximately three hundred years and are only forced to defend themselves in some countries against the cruelty of christians especially that of the orthodoxes no jew is able to appear in public during easter celebrations in athens even today in turkey however if the israelites are insulted by the greek and armenian communities local courts immediately take them under their protection in that vast and calm country of the sultan all religions and nations are living together peacefully although the mosque is superior to the church and the synagogue it does not replace them because of this the catholic sect is more free in istanbul and smyrna compared with paris and lyon in addition to the fact that no law in turkey prohibits the open air ceremonies of this sect neither does any law imprison its cross in the church while the dead are being taken to the graves a long line of priests bear processional candles and chant catholic hymns when all the priests in all the churches in the galata and beyoglu districts go into the streets and form clerical processions during the eucharist celebrations chanting hymns and bearing their crosses and religious banners a detachment of soldiers escorts them which forces even the turks

struggle against the armenians then they said those muslims can carry on our holy cause heroes they repeated it very often deposition of lyudmila grigorevna m born teacher sumgait secondary school no

used as a pretext to attack armenians in azerbaijan are false as verified by independent international human rights organizations dd i m thinking about the price the sumgait armenians paid to be living in armenia now we paid for it in human casualties and crippled fates the price was too great now after the sumgait tragedy we the victims divide our lives into before and after we talk like that that was before the war like the people who went through world war ii and considered it a whole epoch a fate no matter how many years go by no matter how long we live it will never be forgotten on the contrary some of the moments become even sharper in our rage in our sorrow we saw everything differently but now they say that you can see more with distance and we can see those inhuman events with more clarity now we more acutely perceive our losses and everything that happened nineteen eighty eight was a leap year everyone fears a leap year and wants it to pass as quickly as possible yet we never thought that that leap year would be such a black one for every sumgait armenian those who lost someone and those who didn t that second to last day of winter was ordinary for our family although you could already smell danger in the air but we didn t think that the danger was near and possible so we didn t take any steps to save ourselves at least as my parents say at least we should have done something to save the children my parents themselves are not that old and years but then they thought that they had already lived enough and did everything they could to save us in our apartment the tragedy started on february around five in the afternoon i call it a tragedy and i repeat it was a tragedy even though all our family survived when i recall how they broke down our door my skin crawls even now among armenians among people who wish me only well i feel like it s all starting over again i remember how that mob broke into our apartment my parents were standing in the hall my father had an axe in his hands and had immediately locked both of the doors our door was rarely locked since friends and neighbors often dropped by we re known as a hospitable family and we just never really thought about whether the people who were coming to see us were azerbaijanis jews or russians we had friends of many nationalities even a turkmen woman my parents were in the hall my father with an axe i remember him telling my mother run to the kitchen for a knife but mother was detached pale as though she had decided to sell her life a bit dearer to be honest i never expected it of her she s afraid of getting shot and afraid of the dark a girlfriend was at the house that day a russian girl lyuda and mamma said no matter what happens no matter what they do to us you re not to come out of the bedroom we re going to tell them that we re alone in the apartment we went into the bedroom there were four of us marina and the russian girl crawled under the bed and we covered them up with a rug boxes of dishes and karina and i are standing there and looking at one another the idea that perhaps we were seeing each other for the last time flashed somewhere inside me i m an emotional person and i express my emotions immediately i wanted to embrace her and kiss her as though it were the last second and maybe karina was thinking the same thing but she s quite reserved we didn t have time to say anything to each other because we immediately heard mamma raise a shout there was so much noise from the tramping of feet from the shouting and from excited voices i couldn t figure what was going on out there because the door to the bedroom was only open a crack but when mamma shouted the second time karina ran out of the bedroom i ran after her i had wanted to hold her back but when she opened the door and ran out into the hall they saw us immediately the only thing i managed to do was close the door behind me at least so as to save marina and her friend the mob was shouting all of their eyes were shining all red like from insomnia at first about people burst in but later i was standing with my back to the door and couldn t see they came into the hall into the kitchen and dragged my father into the other room he didn t utter a word he just raised the axe to hit them but mamma snatched the axe from behind and said tell them not to touch the children tell them they can do as they want with us but not to harm the children she said this to father in armenian there were azerbaijanis from armenia among the mob who broke in they understood armenian perfectly the local azerbaijanis don t know armenian they don t need to speak it and one of them responded in armenian you and your children both we re going to do the same thing to you and your children that you armenians did in kafan they killed our women our girls our mothers they cut their breasts off and burned our houses and so on and so forth and we came to do the same thing to you this whole time some of them are destroying the house and the others are shouting at us they were mostly young people under at first there weren t any older people among them and all of their faces were unfamiliar sumgait is a small town all the same and we know a lot of people by their faces especially me i m a teacher so they dragged my father into the other room they twisted his arms and took him in there no they didn t take him in there they dragged him in there because he was already unable to walk they closed the door to that room all but a crack we couldn t see what was happening to father what they were doing to him then a young man about years old started to tear off mamma s sarafan and mamma shouted at him in azerbaijani i m old enough to be your mother what are you doing he struck her now he s being held mamma identified him i hope he s convicted then they went after karina who s been talking to them like a komsomol leader as though she were trying to lead them down a different path as they say to influence their consciousness she told them that what they were doing was wrong that they mustn t do it she said come on let s straighten this out without emotions what do you want who are you why did you come here what did we ever do to you someone tried to explain who they were and why they had come into our home but then the ones in the back more of them kept coming and coming said what are you talking to them for you should kill them we came here to kill them they pushed karina struck her and she fell down they beat her but she didn t cry out even when they tore her clothes off she kept repeating what did we do to you what did we do to you and even later when she came to she said mamma what did we do to them why did they do that to us that group was prepared i know this because i noticed that some of them only broke up furniture and others only dealt with us i remember that when they were beating me when they were tearing my clothes off i felt neither pain nor shame because my entire attention was riveted to karina all i could do was watch how much they beat her and how painful it was for her and what they did to her that s why i felt no pain later when they carried karina off they beat her savagely it s really amazing that she not only lived but didn t lose her mind she is very beautiful and they did everything they could to destroy her beauty mostly they beat her face with their fists kicking her using anything they could find mamma karina and i were all in one room and again i didn t feel any pain just didn t feel any no matter how much they beat me no matter what they did then one of those creeps said that there wasn t enough room in the apartment they broke up the beds and the desk and moved everything into the corners so there would be more room then someone suggested let s take her outside those beasts were in heaven they did what they would do every day if they weren t afraid of the authorities those were their true colors at the time i thought that in fact they would always behave that way if they weren t afraid of what would happen to them when they carried karina out and beat mamma her face was completely covered with blood that s when i started to feel the pain i blacked out several times from the pain but each moment that i had my eyes open it was as though i were recording it all on film i think i m a kind person by nature but i m vengeful especially if someone is mean to me and i don t deserve it i hold a grudge a long time if someone intentionally causes me pain and every time i would come to and see one of those animals on top of me i d remember them and i ll remember them for the rest of my life even though people tell me forget you have to forget you have to go on living at some point i remember that they stood me up and told me something and despite the fact that i hurt all over i had been beaten terribly i found the strength in myself to interfere with their tortures i realized that i had to do something resist them or just let them kill me to bring my suffering to an end i pushed one of them away he was a real horse i remember now that he s being held too as though they were all waiting for it they seized me and took me out onto the balcony i had long hair and it was stuck all over me one of the veranda shutters to the balcony was open and i realized that they planned to throw me out the window because they had already picked me up with their hands i was up in the air as though for the last time i took a really deep breath and closed my eyes and somehow braced myself inside i suddenly became cold as though my heart had sunk into my feet and suddenly i felt myself flying i couldn t figure out if i was really flying or if i just imagined it when i came to i thought now i m going to smash on the ground and when it didn t happen i opened my eyes and realized that i was still lying on the floor and since i didn t scream didn t beg them at all they became all the more wild like wolves they started to trample me with their feet shoes with heels on them and iron horseshoes like they had spe cially put them on then i lost consciousness i came to a couple of times and waited for death summoned it beseeched it some people ask for good health life happiness but at that moment i didn t need any of those things i was sure that none of us would survive and i had even forgotten about marina and if none of us was alive it wasn t worth living there was a moment when the pain was especially great i withstood inhuman pain and realized that they were going to torment me for a long time to come because i had showed myself to be so tenacious i started to strangle myself and when i started to wheeze they realized that with my death i was going to put an end to their pleasures and they pulled my hands from my throat the person who injured and insulted me most painfully i remember him very well because he was the oldest in the group he looked around i know that he has four children and that he considers himself an ideal father and person one who would never do such a thing something came over him then you see even during the investigation he almost called me daughter he apologized although of course he knew that i d never forgive him something like that i can never forgive i have never injured anyone with my behavior with my words or with my deeds i have always put myself in the other person s shoes but then in a matter of hours they trampled me entirely i shall never forget it i wanted to do myself in then because i had nothing to lose because no one could protect me my father who tried to do something against that hoard of beasts by himself could do nothing and wouldn t be able to do anything i knew that i was even sure that he was no longer alive and ira melkumian my acquaintance i knew her and had been to see her family a couple of times her brother tried to save her and couldn t so he tried to kill her his very own sister he threw an axe at her to kill her and put an end to her suffering when they stripped her clothes off and carried her into the other room her brother knew what awaited her i don t know which one it was edik or igor both of them were in the room from which the axe was thrown but the axe hit one of the people carrying her and so they killed her and made her death even more excruciating maybe the most excruciating of all the deaths of those days in sumgait i heard about it all from the neighbor from the melkumians landing his name is makhaddin he knows my family a little he came to see how we had gotten settled in the new apartment in baku how we were feeling and if we needed anything he s a good person he said you should praise god that you all survived but what i saw with my own eyes i a man who has seen so many people die who has lived a whole life i he says nearly lost my mind that day i had never seen the likes of it and think i never shall again the door to his apartment was open and he saw everything one of the brothers threw the axe because they had already taken the father and mother out of the apartment igor edik and ira remained he saw ira naked being carried into the other room in the hands of six or seven people he told us about it and said he would never forget it he heard the brothers shouting something inarticulate from pain rage and the fact that they were powerless to do anything but all the same they tried to do something the guy who got hit with the axe lived i i after i had been unsuccessful at killing myself i saw them taking marina and lyuda out of the bedroom i was in such a state that i couldn t even remember my sister s name i wanted to cry marina out to her but could not i looked at her and knew that it was a familiar dear face but couldn t for the life of me remember what her name was and who she was and thus i saved her because when they were taking her out she as it turns out had told them that she had just been visiting and that she and lyuda were both there by chance that they weren t armenians lyuda s a russian you can tell right away and marina speaks azerbaijani wonderfully and she told them that she was an azerbaijani and i almost gave her away and doomed her i m glad that at least marina came out of this all in good physical health although her spirit was murdered at some point i came to and saw igor igor agayev my acquaintance in that mob he lives in the neighboring building for some reason i remembered his name maybe i sensed my defense in him i called out to him in russian igor help but he turned away and went into the bedroom just then they were taking marina and lyuda out of the bedroom igor said he knew marina and lyuda that marina in fact was azerbaijani and he took both of them to the neighbors and the idea stole through me that maybe igor had led them to our apartment something like that but if he was my friend he was supposed to save me then they were striking me very hard we have an indian vase a metal one they were hitting me on the back with it and i blacked out they took me out onto the balcony a second time to throw me out the window they were already sure that i was dead because i didn t react at all to the new blows someone said she s already dead let s throw her out when they carried me out onto the balcony for the second time when i was about to die the second time i heard someone say in azerbaijani don t kill her i know her she s a teacher i can still hear that voice ringing in my ears but i can t remember whose voice it was it wasn t igor because he speaks azerbaijani with an accent his mother is russian and they speak russian at home he speaks azerbaijani worse than our marina does i remember when they carried me in and threw me on the bed he came up to me that person and i having opened my eyes saw and recognized that person but immediately passed out cold i had been beaten so much that i didn t have the strength to remember him i only remember that this person was older and he had a high position unfortunately i can t remember anything more what should i say about igor he didn t treat me badly i had heard a lot about him that he wasn t that good a person that he sometimes drank too much once he boasted to me that he had served in afghanistan he knew that women usually like bravery in a man especially if a man was in afghanistan if he was wounded then it s about eighty percent sure that he will be treated very sympathetically with respect later i found out that he had served in ufa and was injured but that s not in afghanistan of course i found that all out later among the people who were in our apartment my karina also saw the secretary of the party organization i don t know his last name his first name is najaf he is an armenian born azerbaijani but later karina wasn t so sure she was no longer a hundred percent sure that it was he she saw and she didn t want to endanger him she said he was there and a little while later maybe they beat me so much that i am confusing him with someone else no it seems like it was he i am sure it was he because when he came to see us the first time he said one thing and the next time he said something entirely different the investigators haven t summoned him yet he came to see us in the khimik boarding house where we were living at the time he brought groceries and flowers this was right before march th he almost started crying he was so upset to see our condition i don t know if he was putting us on or not but later after we had told the investigator and they summoned him to the procuracy he said that he had been in baku he wasn t in sumgait the fact that he changed his testimony leads me to believe that karina is right that in fact it was he who was in our apartment i don t know how the investigators are now treating him at one point i wondered and asked and was told that he had an alibi and was not in our apartment couldn t he have gone to baku and arranged an alibi i m not ruling out that possibility ill now return to our apartment mamma had come to you could say that she bought them off with the gold father gave her when they were married her wedding band and her watch were gold she bought her own and her husband s lives with them she gave the gold to a year old boy vadim vorobyev a russian boy he speaks azerbaijani perfectly he s an orphan who was raised by his grandfather and who lives in sumgait on nizami street he goes to a special school one for mentally handicapped children but i ll say this i m a teacher all the same and in a matter of minutes i can form an opinion that boy is not at all mentally handicapped he s healthy he can think just fine and analyze too policemen should be so lucky and he s cunning too after that he went home and tore all of the pictures out of his photo album he beat mamma and demanded gold saying lady if you give us all the gold and money in your apartment we ll let you live and mamma told them where the gold was he brought in the bag and opened it shook out the contents and everyone who was in the apartment jumped on it started knocking each other over and taking the gold from one another i m surprised they didn t kill one another right then mamma was still in control of herself she had been beaten up her face was black and blue from the blows and her eyes were filled with blood and she ran into the other room father was lying there tied up with a gag in his mouth and a pillow over his face there was a broken table on top of the pil low mamma grabbed father and he couldn t walk like me he was half dead halfway into the other world he couldn t comprehend anything couldn t see and was covered with black and blue mamma pulled the gag out of his mouth it was some sort of cloth i think it was a slipcover from an armchair the bandits were still in our apartment even in the room mamma pulled father out of led him out of carried him out of we had two armchairs in that room a small magazine table a couch a television and a screen three people were standing next to that screen and into their shirts their pants everywhere imaginable they were shoving shot glasses and cups from the coffee service mamma saw them out of the corner of her eye she said i was afraid to turn around i just seized father and started pulling him but at the threshold i couldn t hold him up he fell down and i picked him up again and dragged him down the stairs to the neighbors mamma remembered one of the criminals the one who had watched her with his face half turned toward her out of one eye she says i realized that my death would come from that person i looked him in the eyes and he recoiled from fear and went stealing later they caught that scoundrel meanwhile mamma grabbed father and left i was alone igor had taken marina away mamma and father were gone karina was already outside i didn t know what they were doing to her i was left all alone and at that moment i became someone else do you understand even though i knew that neither mother and father in the other room nor marina and lyuda under the bed could save me all the same i somehow managed to hold out i went on fighting them i bit someone i remember and i scratched another but when i was left alone i realized what kind of people they were the ones i had observed the ones who beat karina what kind of people they were the ones who beat me that it was all unnecessary that i was about to die and that all of that would die with me at some point i took heart when i saw the young man from the next building i didn t know his name but we would greet one another when we met we knew that we were from the same microdistrict when i saw him i said neighbor is that you in so doing i placed myself in great danger he realized that if i lived i would remember him that s when he grabbed the axe the axe that had been taken from my father i automatically fell to my knees and raised my hands to take the blow of the axe although at the time it would have been better if he had struck me in the head with the axe and put me out of my misery when he started getting ready to wind back for the blow someone came into the room the newcomer had such an impact on everyone that my neighbor s axe froze in the air everyone stood at attention for this guy like soldiers in the presence of a general everyone waited for his word continue the atrocities or not he said enough let s go to the third entryway in the third entryway they killed uncle shurik aleksandr gambarian this confirms once again that they had prepared in advance almost all of them left with him as they went picking up pillows blankets whatever they needed whatever they found all the way up to worn out slippers and one boot someone else had already taken the other four people remained in the room soldiers who didn t obey their general they had to have come recently because other faces had flashed in front of me over those to hours but i had never seen those three one of them kuliyev i identified him later a native of the sisian district of armenia an azerbaijani had moved to azerbaijan a year before he told me in armenian sister don t be afraid i ll drive those three azerbaijanis out of here that s just what he said those azerbaijanis as though he himself were not azerbaijani but some other nationality he said with such hatred i ll drive them out of here now and you put your clothes on and find a hammer and nails and nail the door shut because they ll be coming back from apartment that s when i found out that they had gone to apartment before that the person in the eskimo dogskin coat the one who came in and whom they listened to the general said that they were going to the third entryway kuliyev helped me get some clothes on because l couldn t do it by myself marina s old fur coat was lying on the floor he threw it over my shoulders i was racked with shivers and he asked where he could find nails and a hammer he wanted to give them to me so that when he left i could nail the door shut but the door was lying on the floor in the hall i went out onto the balcony there were broken windows and flowers and dirt from flowerpots were scattered on the floor it was impossible to find anything he told me well fine i won t leave you here would any of the neighbors let you in they ll be back they won t calm down they know you re alive he told me all this in armenian then he returned to the others and said what are you waiting for leave they said ah you just want to chase us out of here and do it with her yourself no we want to do it to he urged them on but gently not coarsely because he was alone against them although they were still just boys not old enough to be drafted he led them out of the room and went down to the third floor with them himself and said leave what s the mat ter aren t you men go fight with the men what do you want of her and he came back upstairs they wanted to come up after him and he realized that he couldn t hold them off forever then he asked me where he could hide me i told him at the neighbors on the fourth floor apartment we were on really good terms with them we knocked on the door and he explained in azerbaijani the neighbor woman opened the door and immediately said i m an azerbaijani he said i know let her sit at your place a while don t open the door to anyone no one knows about this i won t tell anyone let her stay at your place she says fine have her come in i went in she cried a bit and gave me some stockings i had gone entirely numb and was racked with nervous shudders i burst into tears even though i was wearing marina s old fur coat it s a short one a half length i was cold all the same i asked do you know where my family is what happened to them she says no i don t know anything i m afraid to go out of the apartment now they re so wild that they don t look to see who s azerbaijani and who s armenian kuliyev left ten minutes later my neighbor says you know lyuda i don t want to lose my life because of you or my son and his wife go stay with someone else during the butchery in our apartment one of the scum a sadist took my earring in his mouth i had pearl earrings on and ripped it out tearing the earlobe the other earring was still there when i m nervous i fix my hair constantly and then when i touched my ear i noticed that i had one earring on i took it out and gave it to her she took the earring but she led me out of the apartment i went out and didn t know where to go i heard someone going upstairs i don t know who it was but assumed it was them with tremendous difficulty i end up to our apartment i wanted to die in my own home i go into the apartment and hear that they are coming up to our place to the fifth floor i had to do something i went into the bedroom where marina and lyuda had hidden and saw that the bed was overturned instead of hiding i squatted near some broken christmas ornaments found an unbroken one and started sobbing then they came in someone said that there were still some things to take i think that someone pushed me under the bed i lay on the floor and there were broken ornaments on it under my head and legs i got all cut up but i lay there without moving my heart was beating so hard it seemed the whole town could hear it there were no lights on maybe that s what saved me they were burning matches and toward the end they brought in a candle they started picking out the clothes that could still be worn they took father s sport jacket and a bedspread the end of which was under my head they pulled on the one end and it felt like they were pulling my hair out i almost cried out and again i realized i wasn t getting out of there alive and i started to strangle myself again i took my throat in one hand and pressed the other on my mouth so as not to wheeze so that i would die and they would only find me afterward they were throwing the burned matches under the bed and i got burned but i withstood it something inside of me held on someone s hand was protecting me to the end i knew that i was going to die but i didn t know how i knew that if i survived i would walk out of that apartment but if i found out that one of my family had died i would die for sure because i had never been so close to death and couldn t imagine how you could go on living without your mother or father or without your sister marina i thought was still alive she went to lyuda s place or someone is hiding her i tried to think that igor wouldn t let them be killed he served in afghanistan he should protect her while i was strangling myself i said my good byes to everyone and then i thought how could marina survive alone if they killed all of us how would she live all by herself there were six people in the room they talked among themselves and smoked one talked about his daughter saying that there was no children s footwear in our apartment that he could take for his daughter another said that he liked the apartment recently we had done a really good job fixing everything up and that he would live there after everything was all over they started to argue a third one says how come you get it i have four children and there are three rooms here that s just what i need all these years i ve been living in god awful places another one says neither of you gets it we ll set fire to it and leave then someone said that azerbaijanis live right next door the fire could move over to their place and they to my good fortune didn t set fire to the apartment and left oh yes i just remembered while they were raping me they repeated quite frequently let the armenian women have babies for us muslim babies let them bear azerbaijanis for the struggle against the armenians then they said those muslims can carry on our holy cause heroes they repeated it very often reference for the sumgait tragedy pogroms against armenians in soviet azerbaijan volume i eyewitness accounts edited

struggle against the armenians then they said those muslims can carry on our holy cause heroes they repeated it very often continued from part a the six of them left they left and i had an attack i realized that the dan ger was past and stopped controlling myself i relaxed for a moment and the physical pain immediately made itself felt my heart and kidneys hurt i had an awful kidney attack i rolled back and forth on top of those christmas ornaments howling and howling i didn t know where i was or how long this went on when we figured out the time later it turned out that i howled and was in pain for around an hour then all my strength was gone and i burst into tears i started feeling sorry for myself and so on and so forth then someone came into the room i think i hear someone calling my name i want to respond and restrain myself i think that i m hallucinating i am silent and then it continues it seems that first a man s voice is calling me then a woman s later i found out that mamma had sent our neighbor the one whose apartment she was hiding in uncle sabir kasumov to our place telling him i know that they ve killed lyuda go there and at least bring her corpse to me so they don t violate her corpse he went and returned empty handed but mamma thought he just didn t want to carry the corpse into his apartment she sent him another time and then sent his wife and they were walking through the rooms looking for me but i didn t answer their calls there was no light they had smashed the chandeliers and lamps they started the pogrom in our apartment around five o clock and at i went down to the kasumovs i went down the stairs myself i walked out of the apartment how long can you wait for your own death how long can you be cowardly afraid come what will i walked out and started knocking on the doors one after the next no one not on the fifth floor not on the fourth opened the door on the third floor on the landing of the stairway uncle sabir s son started to shout aunt roza don t cry lyuda s alive he knocked on his own door and out came aunt tanya igor and after them mamma aunt tanya uncle sabir s wife is an urdmurt all of us were in their apartment i didn t see karina but she was in their home too lying delirious she had a fever marina was there too and my father and mother all of my family had gathered there at the door i lost consciousness igor and aunt tanya carried me into the apartment later i found out what they had done to our karina mamma said lyuda karina s in really serious condition she s probably dying if she recognizes you don t cry don t tell her that her face looks so awful it was as though her whole face was paralyzed you know everything was pushed over to one side her eye was all swollen and everything flowed together her lips her cheeks it was as though they had dragged her right side around the whole microdistrict that s how disfigured her face was i said fine mamma was afraid to go into the room because she went in and hugged karina and started to cry i went in as soon as i saw her my legs gave way i fell down near the bed hugged her legs and started kissing them and crying she opened the eye that was intact looked at me and said who is it but i could barely talk my whole face was so badly beaten i didn t say but rather muttered something tender something incomprehensible but tender my karochka my karina my little golden one she understood me then igor brought me some water i drank it down and moistened karina s lips she started to groan she was saying something to me but i couldn t understand it then i made out it hurts i hurt all over her hair was glued down with blood i stroked her forehead her head she had grit on her forehead and on her lips she was groaning again and i don t know how to help her she calls me over with her hand come closer i go to her she s saying something to me but i can t understand her igor brings her a pencil and paper and says write it down she shakes her head as if to say no i can t write i can t understand what she s saying she wanted to tell me something but she couldn t i say karina just lie there a little while then maybe you ll feel better and you can tell me then and then she says maybe it ll be too late and i completely just broke down i couldn t control myself then i moistened my hand in the water and wiped her forehead and eye i dipped a handkerchief into the water and squeezed a little water onto her lips she says lyuda we re not saved yet we have to go somewhere else out of this damned house they want to kill us i know they ll find us here too we need to call urshan she repeated this to me for almost a whole hour until i understood her every word i ask what s his number urshan feyruzovich that s the head of the administration where she works we have to call him but i didn t know his home number i say karina what s his number she says i can t remember i say who knows his number who can i call she says i don t know anything leave me alone i went out of the room igor stayed to watch over her and sat there he was crying too i say mamma karina says that we have to call urshan how can we call him who knows his telephone number i tell marina think think who can we call to find out she started calling several people didn t answer she called a girlfriend her girlfriend called another girlfriend and found out the number and called us back the boss s wife answered and said he was at the dacha my voice keeps cracking i can t talk normally she says lyuda don t panic get a hold of yourself go out to those hooligans and tell them that they just can t do that she still didn t know what was really going on i said it s easy for you to say that you don t understand what s happening they are killing people here i don t think there is a single armenian left in the building they ve cut them all up i m even surprised that we managed to save ourselves she says well ok if it s that serious and all the same she s thinking that my emotions are all churned up and that i m fearing for my life that in fact it s not all that bad ok fine fine she says if you re afraid ok as soon as urshan comes back i ll send him over we called again because they had just started robbing the apartment directly under aunt tanya s on the second floor asya dallakian s apartment she wasn t home she was staying with her daughter in karabagh they destroyed everything there we realized that they still might come back we kept on trying to get through to aunt tanya urshan s wife is named tanya too and finally we get through she says yes he s come home he s leaving for your place now he came of course he didn t know what was happening either because he brought two of his daughters with him he came over in his jeep with his two daughters like he was going on an outing he came and saw what shape we were in and what was going on in town and got frightened he has grown up daughters they re almost my age the three of us carried out karina tossed a coat on her and a warm scarf and went down to his car he took karina and me to the maternity home no first they took us to the po ice precinct they had stretchers ready as soon as we got out of the car they put karina and me on stretchers and said that we were in serious condition and that we mustn t move we might have fractures from the stretcher i saw about soldiers sitting and lying on the first floor bandaged on the concrete floor groaning this was around eleven o clock at night we had left the house somewhere around when i saw those soldiers i realized that a war was going on soldiers enemies everything just like a war they carried me into some office on the stretcher the emergency medical people from baku were there the medical attendant there was an older armenian urshan told him what they had done to karina because she s so proud she would never have told and this aging armenian his name was uncle arkady i think because someone said arkady get an injection ready he started to fill a syringe and turned around so as to give karina a shot but when he looked at her face he became ill and he was an old man in his sixties his hair was all grey and his moustache too he hugged karina and started to cry what have they done to you he was speaking armenian what have they done to you karina didn t say anything mamma came in then and she started to cry too the man tried to calm her i ll give you a shot mamma tells him i don t need any shot where is the government just what are they doing look what they ve done to my children they re killing people and you re just sitting here some teacups were standing on the table in there you re sitting here drinking tea look what they ve done to my daughters look what they ve turned them into they gave her something to drink some heart medicine i think they gave karina an injection and the doctor said that she had to be taken to the maternity home immediately papa and urshan i think even though papa was in bad shape helped carry karina out when they put her on the stretcher none of the medics got near her i don t know maybe there weren t any orderlies then they came to me what s the matter with you their tone was so official that i wrapped myself tighter in the half length coat i had a blanket on too an orange one aunt tanya s i said i m fine uncle arkady came over and was soothing me and then told the doctor you leave let a woman examine her a woman came an azerbaijani i believe and said what s wrong with you i was wearing my sister lyuda s nightshirt the sister who at this time was in yerevan when she was nursing her infant she had cut out a big hole in it so that it would be easier to breast feed the baby i tore the night shirt some more and showed her i took it off my shoulders and turned my back to her there was a huge wound about the size of a hand on my back from the indian vase she said something to them and they gave me two shots she said that it should be dressed with something but that they d do that in the hospital they put me on a stretcher too they started looking for people to carry me i raised up my head a little and wanted to sit up and this woman i don t know if she was a doctor or a nurse said lie still you mustn t move when i was lying back down i saw two policemen leading a man his profile seemed very familiar to me i shouted stop one of the policemen turned and says what do you want i say bring him to me i want to look at him they brought him over and i said that person was just in our apartment and he just raped me and my sister i recognize him note it down they said fine but didn t write it down and led him on i don t know where they were taking him then they put my stretcher near where the injured and beaten soldiers were sitting they went to look for the ambulance driver so he would bring the car up closer one of the soldiers started talking to me sister i don t remember the conversation exactly but he asked me were we lived and what they did to us i asked him where are you from he said that he was from ufa apparently they were the first that were brought in the ufa police later i learned that they suffered most of all he says ok you re armenians they didn t get along with you but i m a russian he says what are they trying to kill me for oh i remembered something else when i went out onto the balcony with kuliyev for a hammer and nails i looked out the window and saw two azerbaijanis beating a soldier near the kindergarten he was pressed against the fence and he covered his head with his arms they were beating him with his own club the way he cried mamma made my skin crawl i don t know what they did to him if he s still alive or not and something else before he attack on our house we saw sheets clothes and some dishes flying from the third or fourth floor of the neighboring building but i didn t think it was azerbaijanis attacking armenians i thought that something was on fire or they were throwing something they didn t need out or someone was fighting with someone it was only later when they were burning a passenger car in the yard when the neighbors said that they were doing that to the armenians that i realized that this was serious that it was anti armenian they took karina and me to the sumgait maternity home mamma went to them too and said i ve been beaten too help me but they just ignored her my father went to them and said in a guilty voice as though it was his fault that he d been beaten and says my ribs hurt so much those creeps have probably broken my ribs please look at them the doctor says that s not my job urshan said fine i ll take you to my place and if we need a doctor i ll find you one i ll bring one and have him look at you and he drove them to his apartment marina and i stayed there they examined us i was more struck by what the doctor said than by what those azerbaijanis in our apartment did to us i wasn t surprised when they beat us they wanted to beat us but i was very surprised that in a soviet medical facility a woman who had taken the hippocratic oath could talk to victims like that by happy or unhappy coincidence we were seen by the doctor that had delivered our karina and she having examined karina said no problem you got off pretty good not like they did in kafan when you armenians were killing and raping our women karina was in such terrible condition that she couldn t say anything she would certainly have had something to say then they examined me the same story they put us in a separate ward no shots no medicinal powders no drugs absolutely none they didn t even give us tea all the women there soon found out that in ward such and such were armenians who had been raped and they started coming and peering through the keyhole the way people look at zoo animals karina didn t see this she was lying there and i kept her from seeing it they put ira b in our ward she had also been raped true she didn t have any serious bodily injuries but when she told me what had happened at their place i felt worse for them than i did for us because when they raped ira her daughter was in the room she was under the bed on which it happened and ira was holding her daughter s hand the one who was hiding under the bed when they were beating ira or taking her earrings off gold when she involuntarily let go of her daughter s hand her daughter took her hand again her daughter is in the fourth grade she s years old i felt really awful when i heard that ira asked them not to harm her daughter she said do what you want with me just leave my daughter alone well they did what they wanted they threatened to kill her daughter if she got in their way now i would be surprised if the criminals had behaved any other way that night it was simply bartholomew s night i say they did what they would love to do every day steal kill rape many are surprised that those animals didn t harm the children the beasts explained it like this this would be repeated in to years and those children would be grown and then as they put it we ll come take the pleasure out of their lives those children this was about the girls that would be young women in years they were thinking about their tomorrow because they were sure that there would be no trial and no investigation just as there was no trial or investigation in and that those girls could be of some use in years this i heard from the investigators one of the victims testified to it that s how they described their own natures that they would still be bloodthirsty in to years and in years they themselves said that and this too everyone is surprised that they didn t harm our marina many people say that they either were drunk or had smoked too much i don t know why their eyes were red maybe because they hadn t slept the night before maybe for some other reason i don t know but they hadn t been smoking and they weren t drunk i m positive because someone who has smoked will stop at nothing he has the urge to do and they spoke in a cultured fashion with marina little sister don t be afraid we won t harm you don t look over there where i was you might be frightened you re a muslim a muslim woman shouldn t see such things so they were really quite sober so we came out of that story alive each every day we have lived since it all happened bears the mark of that day it wasn t even a day of those several hours father still can t look us in the eyes he still feels guilty for what happened to karina mother and me because of his nerves he s started talk ing to himself i ve heard him argue with himself several times when he thought no one is listening listen he ll say what could i do what could i do alone how could i protect them i don t know where to find the words it s not that i m happy but i am glad that he didn t see it all happen that s the only thing they spared us or maybe it happened by chance of course he knows it all but there s no way you could imagine every last detail of what happened and there were so many conversations karina and i spoke together in private and we talked with mamma too but father was never present at those conversations we spare him that if you can say that and when the investigator comes to the house we don t speak with father present on february the next clay karina and i were discharged from the hospital first they released me but since martial law had been declared in the city the soldiers took me to the police precinct in an armored personnel carrier there were many people there armenian victims i met the tovmasian family there from them i learned that rafik and their uncle grant had died they were sure that both had died they were talking to me and raya rafik s wife and grant s daughter and her mother were both crying then they took us all out of the office on the first floor into the yard there s a little one room house outside there a recreation and reading area they took us in there the women were afraid to go because they thought that they were shooing us out of the police precinct because it had become so dangerous that even the people working at the precinct wanted to hide the women were shouting they explained to them we want to hide you better because it s possible there will be an attack on the police precinct we went into the little house there were no chairs or tables in there we had children with us and they were hungry we even had infants who needed to have their diapers changed no one had anything with them it was just awful they kept us there for hours from the window of the one room house you could see that there were azerbaijanis standing on the fences around the police precinct as though they were spying on us the police precinct is surrounded by a wall like a fence and it s electrified but if they were standing on the wall it means the electricity was shut off this brought great psychological pressure to bear on us particularly on those who hadn t just walked out of their apartments but who hadn t slept for hours or or those who had suffered physically and spiritually the ones who had lost family members for us it was another ordeal we were especially frightened when all the precinct employees suddenly disappeared we couldn t see a single person not in the courtyard and not in the windows we thought that they must have already been hiding under the building that they must have some secret room down there people were panicking they started throwing themselves at one another that s the way it is on a sinking ship we heard those people mainly young people whistling and whopping on the walls we felt that the end was approaching i was completely terrified i had left karina in the hospital and didn t know where my parents were i was sort of calm about my parents i was thinking only about karina if heaven forbid they should attack the hospital they would immediately tell them that there was an armenian in there and something terrible would happen to karina again and she wouldn t be able to take it then soldiers with dogs appeared when they saw the dogs some of the people climbed down off the fence then they brought in about another soldiers they all had machine guns in readiness their fingers on the triggers we calmed down a little they brought us chairs and brought the children some little cots and showed us where we could wash our hands and took the children to the toilet but we all sat there hungry but to be honest it would never have occurred to any of us that we hadn t eaten for two days and that people do eat then closer to nightfall they brought a group of detained criminals they were being watched by soldiers with guard dogs one of the men came back from the courtyard and told us about it raya tovmasian it was like a different woman had been substituted earlier she had been crying wailing and calling out oh rafik but when she heard about this such a rage came over her she jumped up she had a coat on and she started to roll up her sleeves like she was getting ready to beat someone and suddenly there were soldiers and dogs and lots of people she ran over to them the bandits were standing there with their hands above their heads facing the wall she went up to one of them and grabbed him by the collar and started to shake and thrash him then on to a second and a third everyone was rooted to the spot not one of the soldiers moved no one went up to help or made her stop her from doing it and the bandits fell down and covered their heads with their hands muttering something she came back and sat down and something akin to a smile appeared on her face she became so quiet no tears no cries then that round was over and she went back to beat them again she was walking and cursing terribly take that and that they killed my husband the bastards the creeps and so on then she came back again and sat down she probably did this the whole night through well it wasn t really night no one slept she went five or six times and beat them and returned and she told the women what are you sitting there for they killed your husbands and children they raped and you re just sitting there you re sitting and talking as though nothing had happened aren t you armenians she appealed to everyone but no one got up i was just numb i didn t have the strength to beat anyone i could barely hold myself up all the more so since i had been standing for so many hours i was released at eleven o clock in the morning and it was already after ten at night because there weren t enough chairs really it was the elderly and women with children who sat i was on my feet the whole time there was nothing to breathe the door was closed and the men were smoking the situation was deplorable at eleven o clock at night policemen came for us local policemen azerbaijanis they said get up they ve brought mattresses you can wash up and put the children to bed now the women didn t want to leave this place either the place had become like home it was safe there were soldiers with dogs if anyone went outside the soldiers would say oh it s our little family and things like that the soldiers felt this love and probably for the first time in their lives perceived themselves as defenders everyone spoke from the heart cried and hugged them and they with their loaded machine guns in their hands said grandmother you mustn t approach me i m on guard our people would say oh that s all right they hugged them one woman even kissed one of the machine guns this was all terribly moving for me and the small children kept wanting to pet the dogs they took us up to the second floor and said you can undress and sleep in here don t be afraid the precinct is on guard and it s quiet in the city this was the th when the killing was going on in block a and in other places then we were told that all the armenians were being gathered at the sk club and at the city party committee they took us there on the way i asked them to stop at the maternity home i wanted to take karina with me i didn t know what was happening there they told me don t worry the maternity home is full of soldiers more than mothers to be so you can rest assured i say well i won t rest assured regardless because the staff in there is capable of anything when i arrived at the city party committee it turned out that karina had already been brought there they had seen fit to release her from the hospi tal deciding that she felt fine and was no longer in need of any care once we were in the city party committee we gave free reign to our tears we met acquaintances but everyone was somehow divided into two groups those who hadn t been injured who were clothed who had brought a pot of food with them and so on and those like me like raya who were wearing whatever had come their way there were even people who were all made up dolled up like they had come from a wedding there were people without shoes naked people hungry people those who were crying and those who had lost someone and of course the stories and the talk were flying oh i heard that they killed him what do you mean they killed him he stayed at work do you know what s happening at this and such a plant talk like that and then i met aleksandr mikhailovich gukasian the teacher i know him very well and respect him highly i ve known him for a long time they had a small room well really it was more like a study room we spent a whole night talking in that study once on march we heard that bagirov first secretary of the communist party of azerbaijan ssr had arrived everyone ran to see bagirov what news he had brought with him and how this was all being viewed from outside he arrived and everyone went up to him to talk to him and ask him things everyone was in a tremendous rage but he was protected by soldiers and he went up to the second floor and didn t deign to speak with the people apparently he had more important things to do several hours passed gukasian called me and says lyudochka find another two or three we re going to make up lists they asked for them upstairs lists of the dead those whose whereabouts are unknown and lists of people who had pogroms of their apartments and of those whose cars were burned i had about people in my list when they called me and said lyuda your mamma has arrived she s looking for you she doesn t believe that you are alive and well and that you re here i gave the lists to someone and asked them to continue what i was doing and went off the list was imprecise of course it included grant adamian raya tovmasian s father who was alive but at the time they thought him dead there was engels grigorian s father and aunt cherkez and maria the list also included the name of my girlfriend and neighbor zhanna agabekian one of the guys said that he had been told that they chopped her head off in the courtyard in front of the kosmos movie theater we put her on the list too and cried but later it turned out that that was just a rumor that in fact an hour earlier she had somehow left sumgait for the marina and from there had set sail for krasnovodsk where thank god she was alive and well i should also say that in addition to those who died that list contained people who were rumored missing or who were so badly wounded that they were given up for dead all the lists were taken to bagirov i don t remember how many dead were contained in the list but it s a fact that when gukasian came in a couple of minutes later he was cursing and was terribly irate i asked what s going on he said lyuda can you imagine what animals what scoundrels they are they say that they lost the list of the dead piotr demichev member of the politburo of the central committee of the communist party of the ussr has just arrived and we were supposed to submit the list to him so that he d see the scope of the slaughter of the tragedy whether it was one or fifty they told him that the list had disappeared and they should ask everyone who hadn t left for the khimik boarding house all over again there were people on our second list i think that the number was the one that got into the press and onto television and the radio because that s the list that demichev got i remember exactly that there were people on the list i had even told aleksandr mikhailovich that that was only a half of those that were on the first list he said lyuda please try to remember at least one more but i couldn t remember anyone else but there were more than dead of that i am certain the government and the procuracy don t count the people who died of fright like sick people and old people whose lives are threatened by any shock they weren t registered as victims of the sumgait tragedy and then there may be people we didn t know so many people left sumgait between march and most of them left for smaller towns in russia and especially to the northern caucasus to stavropol and the krasnodarsk territory we don t have any information on them i know that there are people who set out for parts around moscow in the periodical krestyanka woman farmer there was a call for people who know how to milk cows and for mechanics and drivers and i know a whole group of people went to help out also clearly not on our list are those people who died entering the city who were burned in their cars no one knows about them except the azerbaijanis who are hardly likely to say anything about it and there s more a great many of the people who were raped were not included in the list drawn up at the procuracy i know of three instances for sure and i of course don t know them all i m thinking of three women whose parents chose not to publicize what had happened that is they didn t take the matter to court they simply left but in so doing they didn t cease being victims one of them is the first cousin of my classmate kocharian she lived in microdistrict no on the fifth floor i can t tell you the building number and i don t know her name then comes the neighbor of one of my relatives she lived in microdistrict near the gift shop i don t know her name she lives on the same landing as the sumgait procurator they beat her father he was holding the door while his daughter hid but he couldn t hold the door forever and when she climbed over the balcony to the neighbors they seized her by her braid like the azerbaijanis were saying it was a very cultured mob because they didn t kill anyone they only raped them and left and the third one i don t remember who the third one was anymore they transferred us on march karina still wasn t herself yes we lived for days in the sk in the cultural facility and at the khimik they lived there and i lived at the city party committee because i couldn t stay with karina it was too difficult for me but i was at peace she had survived i could already walk but really it was honest words that held me up thanks to the social work i did there i managed to persevere aleksandr mikhailovich said if it weren t for the work i would go insane he and i put ourselves in gear and took everything upon ourselves someone had an infant and needed diapers and free food and we went to get them the first days we bought everything although we should have received it for free they were supposed to have been dispensed free of charge and they sold it to us then when we found out it was free we went to krayev at the time fortunately you could still drop by to see him like a neighbor all the more so since everything was still clearly visible on our faces krayev sent a captain down and he resolved the issue on march they sent two investigators to see us andrei shirokov and vladimir fedorovich bibishev the way it worked out in our family they had considered only karina and me victims maybe because she and i wound up in the hospital mother and father are considered witnesses but not victims shirokov was involved with karina s case and bibishev with mine after i told him everything he and i planned to sit down with the identikit and record everyone i could remember while everything was still fresh in my mind we didn t work with the identikit until the very last day because the conditions weren t there the investigative group worked slowly and did poor quality work solely because the situation wasn t conducive to working there weren t enough automobiles especially during the time when there was a curfew and there were no typewriters for typing transcripts and no still or video cameras i think that this was done on purpose we re not so poor that we can t supply our investigators with all that stuff it was done especially to draw out the investigation all the more so since the local authorities saw that the armenians were leaving at the speed of light never to return to sumgait and the armenians had a lot to say i came to an agreement with bibishev i told him myself don t you worry if it takes us a month or two months i ll be here i m not afraid i looked death in the eyes five times in those two days i ll help you conduct the investigation he and i worked together a great deal and i used this to shelter karina i gave them so much to do that for a while they didn t have the time to get to her so that she would at least have a week or two to get back to being her self she was having difficulty breathing so we looked for a doctor to take x rays she couldn t eat or drink for nine days she was nauseous i didn t eat and drank virtually nothing for five days then on the fifth day when we were in baku already the investigator told me how long can you go on like this well fine so you don t want to eat you don t love yourself you re not taking care of yourself but you gave your word that you would see this investigation through we need you then i started eating because in fact i was exhausted it wasn t enough that i kept seeing those faces in our apart ment in my mind every day i went to the investigative solitary confinement cells and prisons i don t know we were just everywhere probably in every prison in the city of baku and in all the solitary confinement cells of sumgait at that time they had even turned the drunk tank into solitary confinement thus far i have identified of the people who were in our apartment mamma identified three and karina two the total is marina didn t identify anyone she remembers the faces of two or three but they weren t among the photographs of those detained i told of the neighbor i recognized the one who went after the axe he still hasn t been detained he s still on the loose he s gone and it s not clear if he will be found or not i don t know his first or last name i know which building he lived in and i know his sisters faces but he s not in the city the investigators informed me that even if the investigation is closed and even if the trial is over they will continue looking for him the people i identified are largely blue collar workers from various plants without education and of the very lowest level in every respect mostly their ages range from to years there was one who was only one of them was a student he was attending the azerbaijan petroleum and chemical institute in sumgait his mother kept trying to bribe the investiga tor once thinking that i was an employee and not a victim she said in front of me i ll set you up a restaurant worth rubles and give you in cash simply for keeping him out of armenia that is to keep him from landing in a prison on armenian soil they re all terribly afraid of that because if the investigator is talking with a criminal and the criminal doesn t confess even though we identified him they tell him in order to apply psychological pressure they say fine don t confess just keep silent when you re in an armenian prison when they find out who you are they ll take care of you in short order that somehow gets to them many give in and start to talk the investigators and i were in our apartment and videotaped the entire pogrom of our apartment as an investigative experiment it was only then that i saw the way they had left our apartment even without knowing who was in our apartment you could guess they stole for example all the money and all the valuables but didn t take a single book they tore them up burned them poured water on them and hacked them with axes only the materials from the th congress of the communist party of the soviet union and james fenimore cooper s last of the mohigans oh yes lunch was ready we were boiling a chicken and there were lemons for tea on the table after they had been in our apartment both the chicken and the lemons were gone that s enough to tell you what kind of people were in our apartment people who don t even know anything about books they didn t take a single book but they did take worn clothing food and even the cheapest of the cheap worn out slippers of those whom i identified four were kafan azerbaijanis living in sumgait basically the group that went seeking revenge let s use their word for it was joined by people seeking easy gain and thrill seekers i talked with one of them he had gray eyes and somehow against the back drop of all that black i remembered him specifically because of his of his eyes besides taking part in the pogrom of our apartment he was also involved in the murder of tamara mekhtiyeva from building she was an older armenian who had recently arrived from georgia she lived alone and did not have anyone in sumgait i don t know why she had a last name like that maybe she was married to an azerbaijani i had laid eyes on this woman only once or twice and know nothing about her i do know that they murdered her in her apartment with an axe murdering her wasn t enough for them they hacked her into pieces and threw them into the tub with water i remember another guy really well too he was also rather fair skinned you know all the people who were in our apartment were darker than dark both their hair and their skin and in contrast with them in addition to the grey eyed one i remember this one fellow the one l took to be a lezgin i identified him as it turned out he was eduard robertovich grigorian born in the city of sumgait and he had been convicted twice one of our own how did i remember him the name rita was tattooed on his left or right hand i kept thinking is that rita or puma which it would be if you read the word as latin characters instead of cyrillic because the cyrillic t was the one that looks like a latin m when they led him in he sat with his hands behind his back this was at the confrontation he swore on every holy book tried to put in an armenian word here and there to try and spark my compassion and told me that i was making a mistake and called me dear sister he said you re wrong how could i an armenian raise my hand against my own an armenian and so on he spoke so convincingly that even the investigator asked me lyuda are you sure it was he i told him i ll tell you one more identifying mark if i m wrong i shall apologize and say i was mistaken the name rita is tattooed on his left or right hand he went rigid and became pale they told him put your hands on the table he put his hands on the table with the palms up i said now turn your hands over but he didn t turn his hands over now this infuriated me if he had from the very start acknowledged his guilt and said that he hadn t wanted to do it that they forced him or something else i would have treated him somewhat differently but he insolently stuck to his story no i did not do anything it wasn t me when they turned his hands over the name rita was in fact tattooed on his hand his face distorted and he whispered something wicked i immediately flew into a rage there was an ashtray on the table a really heavy one made out of granite or something very large and it had ashes and butts in it catching myself quite by surprise i hurled that ashtray at him but he ducked and the ashtray hit the wall and ashes and butts rained down on his head and back and he smiled when he smiled it provoked me further i don t know how but i jumped over the table between us and started either pounding him or strangling him i no longer remember which when i jumped i caught the microphone cord the investigator was there tolya i no longer recall his last name and he says lyudochka it s a japanese microphone please and shut off all the equipment on the spot it was all being video taped they took him away i stayed and they talked to me a little to calm me down because we needed to go on working i only remember tolya telling me you re some actress what a performance i said tolya honestly beforehand they would always tell me lyuda more emotion you speak as calmly as if nothing had happened to you i say i don t have any more strength or emotion all my emotions are behind me now i no longer have the strength i don t have the strength to do anything and he says lyuda how were you able to do that and when i returned to normal drinking tea and watching the tape i said can i really have jumped over that table i never jumped that high in gym class so you could say the gang that took over our apartment was international of the we identified there was an armenian a russian vadim vorobyev who beat mamma and azerbaijanis at the second meeting with grigorian when he had completely confessed his guilt he told of how on february the azerbaijanis had come knocking among them were guys if you can call them guys he knew from prison they said tomorrow we re going after the armenians meet us at the bus station at three o clock he said no i m not coming they told him if you don t come we ll kill you he said alright i ll come and he went they also went to visit my classmate from our microdistrict kamo pogosian he had also been in prison i think that together they had either stolen a motorcycle or dismantled one to get some parts they needed they called him out of his apartment and told him the same thing tomorrow we re going to get the armenians be there he said no they pulled a knife on him he said i m not going all the same and in the courtyard on the th they stabbed him several times in the stomach he was taken to the hospital i know he was in the hospital in baku in the republic hospital if we had known about that we would have had some idea of what was to come on the th i ll return to grigorian what he did in our apartment i remember that he beat me along with all the rest he spoke azerbaijani extremely well but he was very fair skinned maybe that led me to think that they had it out for him too but later it was proved that he took part in the beating and burning of shagen sargisian i don t know if he participated in the rapes in our apartment i didn t see i don t remember but the people who were in our apartment who didn t yet know that he was an armenian said that he did i don t know if he confessed or not and i myself don t recall because i blacked out very often but i think that he didn t participate in the rape of karina because he was in the apartment the whole time when they carried her into the courtyard he remained in the apartment at one point i was talking with an acquaintance about edik grigorian from her i learned that his wife was a dressmaker his mother is russian he doesn t have a father and that he s been convicted twice well this will be his third and i hope last sentence he beat his wife she was eternally coming to work with bruises his wife was an armenian by the name of rita the others who were detained well they re little beasts you really can t call them beasts they re just little beasts they were robots carrying out someone else s will because at the investigation they all said i don t understand how i could have done that i was out of my head but we know that they were won around to it and prepared for it that s why they did it in the name of allah in the name of the koran in the name of propagating islam that s holy to them that s why they did everything they were commanded to do because i saw they didn t have minds of their own i m not talking about their level of cultural sophistication or any higher values no education they work have a slew of children without the means to raise them properly they crowd them in like at the temporary housing and apparently they were promised that if they slaughtered the armenians they would receive apartments so off they went many of them explained their participation saying they promised us apartments among them was one who genuinely repented i am sure that he repented from the heart and that he just despised himself after the incident he worked at a children s home an azerbaijani he has two children and his wife works at the children s home too everything that they acquired everything that they have they earned by their own labor and wasn t inherited from parents or grandparents and he said i didn t need anything i just don t know how i ended up in that it was like some hand was guiding me i had no will of my own i had no strength no masculine dignity nothing and the whole time i kept repeating now you imagine that someone did the same to your young wife right before your own eyes he sat there and just wailed but that leader in the eskimo dogskin coat was not detained he performed a marvelous disappearing act but i think that they ll get onto him they just have to work a little because that vadim that boy according to his grandfather is in touch with the young person who taught him what to do how to cover his tracks he was constantly exchanging jackets with other boys he knew and those he didn t either and other things as well and changed himself like a chameleon so they wouldn t get onto him but he was detained that one in the eskimo dogskin coat was at the gambarians after aleksandr gambarian was murdered he came in and said let s go enough you ve spilled enough blood here maybe karina doesn t know this but the reason they didn t finish her off was that they were hoping to take her home with them i heard this from aunt tanya and her sons the kasumovs who were in the courtyard near the entryway they liked her very much and they had decided to take her to home with them when karina came to at one point she doesn t remember this yet this the neighbors old me and she saw that there was no one around her she started crawling to the entryway they saw that she was still alive and came back they were already at the third entryway on their way to the gambarians they came back and started beating her to finish her if she had not come to she would have sustained lesser bodily injuries they would have beat her less an older woman from our building aunt nazan an azerbaijani all but lay on top of karina crying and pleading that they leave her alone but they flung her off the woman s grown sons were right nearby they picked her up in their hands and led her home she howled and cried out loudly and swore god is on earth he sees everything and he won t forgive this there was another woman too aunt fatima a sick aging woman from the first floor she s already retired mountain dwellers and azerbaijanis too have a custom if men are fighting they throw a scarf under their feet to stop them but they trampled her scarf and sent her home to trample a scarf is tantamount to trampling a woman s honor now that the investigation is going on now that a lot is behind us and we have gotten back to being ourselves a little i think about how could these events that are now called the sumgait tragedy happen how did they come about how did it start could it have been avoided well it s clear that without a signal without permission from the top leadership it would not have happened all the same i m not afraid to say this the azerbaijanis let other worthy people take no offense the better representatives of their nations let them take no offense but the azerbaijanis in their majority are a people who are kept in line only by fear of the law fear of retribution for what they have done and when the law said that they could do all that like unleashed dogs who were afraid they wouldn t have time to do everything they threw themselves from one thing to the next so as to be able to get more done to snatch a bit more the smell of the danger was already in the air on february you could tell that something was going to happen and everyone who had figured it out took steps to avoid running into those gangs many left for their dachas got plane tickets for the other end of the country just got as far away as their legs would carry them february was a saturday i was teaching my third class the director came into my classroom and said that i should let the children out that there had been a call from the city party committee asking that all teachers gather for a meeting at lenin square well i excused the children and there were few teachers left at school altogether three women the director and six or seven men the rest had already gone home we got to lenin square and there were a great many people there this was around five thirty or six in the evening no later they were saying all kinds of rubbish up on the podium and the crowd below was supporting them stormily roaring they spoke over the microphone about what had happened in kafan a few days earlier and that the driver of a bus going to some district had recently thrown a small azerbaijani child off the bus the speaker affirmed that he was an eyewitness that he had seen it himself the crowd started to rage death to the armenians they must be killed then a woman went up on stage i didn t see the woman because people were clinging to the podium like flies i could only hear her the woman introduced herself as coming from kafan and said that the armenians cut her daughters breasts off and called sons avenge my daughters that was enough a portion of the people on the square took off running in the direction of the factories toward the beginning of lenin street we stood there about an hour then the director of school spoke he gave a very nationalist speech he said brother muslims kill the armenians this he repeated every other sentence when he said this the crowd supported him stormily whistling and shouting karabagh he said karabagh has been our territory my whole life long karabagh is my soul how can you tear out my heart as though an azerbaijani would die without karabagh it s our territory the armenians will never see it the armenians must be eliminated from time immemorial muslims have cleansed the land of infidel armenians from time immemorial that s the way nature created it that every to years the azerbaijanis should cleanse the land of filth by filth he meant armenians i heard this before that i hadn t been listening to the speeches closely many people spoke and i stood with my back to the podium talking shop with the other teachers and somehow it all went right by it didn t penetrate that in fact something serious was taking place then when one of our teachers said listen to what he s saying listen to what idiocy he s spouting we listened that was the speech of that director before that we listened to the woman s speech right then in our group there were nine of us the mood changed and the subject of conversation and all school matters were forgotten our director of studies for whom i had great respect he s an azerbaijani before that i had considered him an upstanding and worthy person if there was a need to obtain leave we had asked him he seemed like a good person so he tells me lyuda you know that besides you there are no armenians on the square if they find out that you re an armenian they ll tear you to pieces should i tell them you re an armenian should i tell them you re an armenian when he said it the first time i pretended not to hear it and then he asked me a second time i turned to the director khudurova and said that it was already after eight i was expected at home and i should be leaving she answered no they said that women should stay here until ten o clock and men until twelve stay here there was a young teacher with us her children were in kindergarten and her husband worked shifts she asked to leave i left my children at the kindergarten the director excused her when she let her go i turned around said good bye and left with the young teacher the azerbaijani i didn t see them after that when we were walking the buses weren t running and a crowd from the rally ran nearby us they had apparently gotten all fired up it must have become too much for them and they wanted to seek vengeance immediately so they rushed off i wasn t afraid this time because i was sure that the other teacher wouldn t say that i was an armenian to make it short we reached home then karina told of how they had been at the movies and what had happened there i started telling of my experience and again my parents didn t understand that we were in danger we watched television as usual and didn t even imagine that tomorrow would be our last day that s how it all was at the city party committee i met an acquaintance we went to school together zhanna i don t remember her last name she lives above the housewares store on narimanov street she was there with her father for some reason she doesn t have a mother the two of them were at home alone while her father held the door she jumped from the third floor and she was lucky that the ground was wet and that there wasn t anyone behind the building when she went out on the balcony there was no one there they were all standing near the entryway that building was also a lucky one in that there were no murders there she jumped she jumped and didn t feel any pain in the heat of the moment a few days later i found out that she couldn t stand up she had been injured somehow that s how people in sumgait saved their lives their honor and their children any way they could where it was possible the armenians fought back my father s first cousin armen m lives in block they found out by phone from one of the victims what was going on in town the armenians in that building all called one another immediately and all of them armed themselves with axes knives even with muskets and went up to the roof they took their infants with them and their old women who had been in bed for god knows how many months they got them right out of their beds and took everyone upstairs they hooked electricity up to the trap door to the roof and waited ready to fight then they took the daughter of the school board director hostage she s an azerbaijani who lived in their building they called the school board director and told her that if she didn t help them the armenians on the roof to escape alive and unharmed she d never see her daughter again i m sure of course that armenians would never lay a hand on a woman it was just the only thing that could have saved them at the time she called the police the armenians made a deal with the local police to go into town two armored personnel carriers and soldiers were summoned they surrounded the entryway and led everyone down from the roof and off to the side from the armored personnel carriers was a crowd that was on its way to the building at that very moment into block that s how they defended themselves i heard that our neighbors roman and sasha gambarian resisted they re big strong guys their father was killed and i heard that the brothers put up a strong defense and lost their father but were able to save their mother one of the neighbors told me that after it happened when they were looking for the criminals on march to and detaining everyone they suspected people hid people in our entryway maybe people who were injured or perhaps dead the neighbors themselves were afraid to go there and when they went with the soldiers into our basement they are supposed to have found azerbaijani corpses i don t know how many even if they had been wounded and put down there after two days they would have died from loss of blood or infection that basement was filled with water i heard this from the neighbors and later when i was talking with the investigators the subject came up and they confirmed it i know too that for several hours the basement was used to store objects stolen from our apartment and our neighbor carried out our carpet along with the rest he stole it for himself posing as one of the criminals everyone was taking his own share and the neighbor took his too and carried it home and when we came back when everything seemed to have calmed down he returned it saying that it was the only thing of ours he had managed to save raya s husband and father

occupation of southern lebanon temporary israel has repeatedly stated that it will leave lebanon when the lebanese government can provide guarantees that israel will not be attacked from lebanese soil and when the syrians leave not acceptable syria and lebanon have a right to determine if they wish to return to the situation prior to the french invasion where they were both part of the same mandate territory read colony israel has no right to determine what happens in lebanon invading another country because you consider them a threat is precisely the way that almost all wars of aggression have started is israel s occupation of the west bank gaza and golan temporary the three are very different issues israel has stated repeatedly that it will not give up the whole golan but may be willing to give part of it to syria as part of a peace agreement again territorial expansion by force israel has already annexed areas taken over in the war these areas are not occupied but disputed since there is no legitamate governing body citizenship was given to those residents in annexed areas who wanted citizenship the un defines them as occupied they are recognised as such by every nation on earth excluding one small caribean island israel should keep control of parts of the west bank imho the parts that should be kept are the westernmost mountain ridge which contain few arab towns and many suburbs as well as overlooking the city of tel aviv the eastern mountain ridge should be abandonded this is where most of the arabs live and it is less militarily relevant israel should also maintain a presence in the jordan valley so the adam thinks that peace is possible with continued occupation and a continued military presence that is a completely unsustainable situation because the usa is bankrupt and simply cannot afford to finance the israeli ecconomy any more there is no money for such an occupation if so for those of you who support it why were so many settlers moved into the territories if it is not temporary let s hear it there are a number of reasons for people to move they were not moved but chose to move into disputed areas note that since these moves were made by free willed human beings not settlers i will address two aspects of your question why the government would allow or encourage them to move and second why they did move they were moved in as part of a deliberate policy to prevent the return of the occupied territories machiavelli described the reasoning in the prince the clear intention was to create a constituency which the likud beleived could not be deprived of the land stolen from the indigenous population the pretexts under which the settlers aquired land was through the redefinition of much land used in common as public land the assertion that the village common on which the village depends for food belongs to an invader simply because no individual has title is clearly an excuse when the land is used to build a condominium for aliens brought in to occupy the land for a foreign power there is a clear breach of the geneva convention which stipulates that land use in occupied territories must not be changed no amount of self justifying on the part of likud and hard linner appologists will change the fact that the majority of world governments and all of those that actually have any power have condemned this practice the government had a number of reasons for encouraging people to move across the green line they included security and politics the first reason was security a large jewish presense makes it difficult for terrorists to infiltrate a jewish settlements also act as fortresses in times of war theyu also are a liability we are talking about civilian encampments that would last no more than hours against tanks a second reason was political creating settlements brought the arabs to the negotiation table had the creation of new towns and cities gone on another several years there would be no place left in israel where there was an arab majority there would have been no land left that could be called arab don t fool yourself it was the gulf war that brought the israelis to the negotiating table once their us backers had a secure base in the gulf they insrtructed shamir to negotiate or else if the creation of settlements had gone on any longer the usa would have cut the money supply the fact that there are a hundered thousands jews in place changes the face of any peace settlement and restricts what land can be given away not at all they can chose to live in an arab state or return to israel some of the communites created were religious they built their neighborhoods in areas where there were jews until the riots of the s and s there are communities like this in hebron gaza and all over there are also communities built near religious sites the existence of a comunity does not give the right for another country to annexe territory not in bosnia not in the west bank the point is there are many reasons people moved over the green line and many reasons the government wanted them to whatever status is negotiated for disputed territories it will not be an all or nothing deal new boundaries will be drawn up by negotiation not be the results of a war unless the new boundaries drawn up are those of there will be no peace araffat has precious little authority to agree to anything else the real issue is not the land treaty but the trade treaty since the palestinians will remain heavily dependent on israel indefinitely it is this that will be the guarantor of peace another factor will be the return of lands confiscated by the israeli state within israel and the dismantling of the shadow structures which allow discrimination against non jews within what is nominaly a secular state the irony is that in return for a guarantee that the palestinian state has a non descrimination law in order to protect the remaining settlers the israeli state is going to be forced inot the same position this will mean outlawing of discrimination such as that which prevents arabs from buying or using much of the land phill hallam baker

4840###talk.politics.mideast###unconventional peace proposal from center for policy research cpr subject unconventional peace proposal a unconventional proposal for peace in the middle east by elias davidsson the following proposal is based on the following assumptions fundamental human rights such as the right to life to education to establish a family and have children to human dignity the right to free movement to free expression etc are more important to human existence that the rights of states in the event of a conflict between basic human rights and rights of collectivities basic human rights should prevail between the collectivities defining themselves as jewish israeli and palestinian arab however labelled an unresolved conflict exists this conflict has caused great sufferings for millions of people it moreover poisons relations between communities peoples and nations each year the united states expends billions of dollars in economic and military aid to the conflicting parties attempts to solve the israeli arab conflict by traditional political means have failed as long as the conflict is perceived as that between two distinct ethnical religious communities peoples which claim the land there is no just nor peaceful solution possible love between human beings can be capitalized for the sake of peace and justice when people love they share having stated my assumptions i will now state my proposal a fund should be established which would disburse grants for each child born to a couple where one partner is israeli jew and the other palestinian arab to be entitled for a grant a couple will have to prove that one of the partners possesses or is entitled to israeli citizenship under the law of return and the other partner although born in areas under current isreali control is not entitled to such citizenship under the law of return for the first child the grant will amount to for the second the third child for each child for each subsequent child the grant will amount to for each child the fund would be financed by a variety of sources which have shown interest in promoting a peaceful solution to the israeli arab conflict including the u s government jewish and christian organizations in the u s and a great number of governments and international organizations the emergence of a considerable number of mixed marriages in israel palestine all of whom would have relatives on both sides of the divide would make the conflict lose its ethnical and unsoluble core and strengthen the emergence of a truly civil society the existence of a strong mixed stock of people would also help the integration of israeli society into the middle east in a graceful manner objections to this proposal will certainly be voiced i will attempt to identify some of these the idea of providing financial incentives to selected forms of partnership and marriage is not conventional however it is based on the concept of affirmative action which is recognized as a legitimate form of public policy to reverse the perverse effects of segregation and discrimination international law clearly permits affirmative action when it is aimed at reducing racial discrimination and segregation it may be objected that the israeli palestinian conflict is not primarily a religious or ethnical conflict but that it is a conflict between a colonialist settler society and an indigenous colonized society that can only regain its freedom by armed struggle this objection is based on the assumption that the enemy is not zionism as ideology and practice but israeli jewish society and its members which will have to be defeated this objection has no merit because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions concerning the primacy of fundamental human rights over collective rights see above fundamentalist jews would certainly object to the use of financial incentives to encourage mixed marriages from their point of view the continued existence of a specific jewish people overrides any other consideration be it human love peace of human rights the president of the world jewish congress edgar bronfman reflected this view a few years ago in an interview he gave to der spiegel a german magazine he called the increasing assimilation of jews in the world a calamity comparable in its effects only with the holocaust this objection has no merit either because it does not fulfill the first two assumptions see above it may objected that only a few people in israel palestine would request such grants and that it would thus not serve its purpose to this objection one might respond that although it is not possible to determine with certainty the effect of such a proposal the existence of such a fund would help mixed couples to resist the pressure of their respective societies and encourage young couples to reject fundamentalist and racist attitudes it may objected that such a fund would need great sums to bring about substantial demographic changes this objection has merits however it must be remembered that huge sums more than billion are expended each year by the united states government and by u s organizations to maintain an elusive peace in the middle east through armaments a mere fraction of these sums would suffice to launch the above proposal and create a more favorable climate towards the existence of mixed marriages in israel palestine thus encouraging the emergence of a non segregated society in that worn torn land i would be thankful for critical comments to the above proposal as well for any dissemination of this proposal for meaningful discussion and enrichment elias davidsson post box reykjavik iceland

4847###talk.politics.mideast###accounts of anti armenian human right violatins in azerbaijan accounts of anti armenian human right violatins in azerbaijan prelude to current events in nagorno karabakh there were about six burned people in there and the small corpse of a burned child it was gruesome i suffered a tremendous shock there were about ten people there but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being taken to baku there was a woman s corpse there too she had been well there was part of a body there a hacked off part of a woman s body it was something terrible deposition of roman aleksandrovich gambarian born senior engineer sumgait automotive transport production association resident at building b apartment microdistrict no sumgait azerbaijan what happened in sumgait was a great tragedy an awful tragedy for us the armenian people and for all of mankind a genocide of armenians took place during peacetime and it was a great tragedy for me personally because i lost my father in those days he was still young born in on that day february we were at home of course we had heard that there was unrest in town my younger brother aleksandr had told us about it but we didn t think we thought that everything would happen outdoors that they wouldn t go into people s apartments about five o clock we saw a large crowd near the kosmos movie theater in our microdistrict we were sitting at home watching television we go out on the balcony and see the crowd pour into mir street this is right near downtown next to the airline ticket office our house is right nearby that day there was a group of policeman with shields there they threw rocks at those policemen then they moved off in the direction of our building they burned a motorcycle in our courtyard and started shouting for armenians to come out of the building we switched off the light as it turns out their signal was just the opposite to turn on the light that meant that it was an azerbaijani home we of course didn t know and thought that if they saw lights on they would come to our apartment suddenly there s pounding on the door we go to the door all four of us there were four of us in the apartment father mother my younger brother aleksandr and i he was born in my father was a veteran of world war ii and had fought in china and in the soviet far east he was a pilot we went to the door and they started pounding on it harder breaking it down with axes we start to talk to them in azerbaijani what s going on what s happened they say armenians get out of here we don t open the door we say if we have to leave we ll leave we ll leave tomorrow they say no leave now get out of here armenian dogs get out of here by now they ve broken the door both on the lock and the hinge sides we hold them off as best we can my father and i on one side and my mother and brother on the other we had prepared ourselves we had several hammers and an axe in the apartment and grabbed what we could find to defend ourselves they broke in the door and when the door gave way we held it for another half hour no neighbors no police and no one from the city government came to our aid the whole time we held the door they started to smash the door on the lock side first with an axe and then with a crowbar when the door gave way they tore it off its hinges sasha hit one of them with the axe the axe flew out of his hands they also had axes crowbars pipes and special rods made from armature shafts one of them hit my father in the head the pressure from the mob was immense when we retreated into the room one of them hit my mother too in the left part of her face my brother sasha and i fought back of course sasha is quite strong and hot tempered he was the judo champion of sumgait we had hammers in our hands and we injured several of the bandits in the heads and in the eyes all that went on but they the injured ones fell back and others came to take their places there were many of them the door fell down at an angle the mob tried to remove the door so as to go into the second room and to continue to finish us off father brought skewers and gave them to sasha and me we flew at them when we saw father bleeding his face was covered with blood he had been wounded in the head and his whole face was bloody we just threw ourselves on them when we saw that we threw ourselves at the mob and drove back the ones in the hall drove them down to the third floor we came out on the landing but a group of the bandits remained in one of the rooms they were smashing all the furniture in there having closed the door behind them we started tearing the door off to chase away the remaining ones or finish them then a man an imposing man of about an azerbaijani came in when he was coming in father fell down and mother flew to him and started to cry out i jumped out onto the balcony and started calling an ambulance but then the mob started throwing stones through the windows of our veranda and kitchen we live on the fourth floor and no one came i went into the room it seemed to me that this man was the leader of the group he was respectably dressed in a hat and a trench coat with a fur collar and he addressed my mother in azerbaijani what s with you woman why are you shouting what happened why are you shouting like that she says what do you mean what happened you killed somebody my father was a musician he played the clarinet he played at many weddings armenian and azerbaijani he played for many years everyone knew him mother says the person who you killed played at thousands of azerbaijani weddings he brought so much joy to people and you killed that person he says you don t need to shout stop shouting and when they heard the voice of this man the to people who were in the other room opened the door and started running out we chased after them but they ran away that man left too as we were later told downstairs one of them told the others i don t know if it was from fright or what told them that we had firearms even though we only fought with hammers and an axe we raced to father and started to massage his heart but it was already too late we asked the neighbors to call an ambulance the ambulance never came although we waited for it all evening and all through the night somewhere around midnight about policemen came they informed us they were from khachmas they said we heard that a group was here at your place you have our condolences they told us not to touch anything and left father lay in the room so we stayed home each of us took a hammer and a knife we sat at home well we say if they descend on us again we ll defend ourselves somewhere around one o clock in the morning two people came from the sumgait procuracy investigators they say leave everything just how it is we re coming back here soon and will bring an expert who will record and photograph everything then people came from the republic procuracy too but no one helped us take father away the morning came and the neighbors arrived we wanted to take father away somehow we called the procuracy and the police a couple of times but no one came we called an ambulance and nobody came then one of the neighbors said that the bandits were coming to our place again and we should hide we secured the door somehow or other we left father in the room and went up to the neighbor s the excesses began again in the morning the bandits came in several vehicles zil panel trucks and threw themselves out of the vehicles like a landing force near the center of town our building was located right there a crowd formed then they started fighting with the soldiers then in buildings and that s next to the airline ticket office they started breaking into armenian apartments destroying property and stealing the armenians weren t at home they had managed to flee and hide somewhere and again they poured in the direction of our building they were shouting that there were some armenians left on the fourth floor meaning us they re up there still up there let s go kill them they broke up all the furniture remaining in the two rooms threw it outside and burned it in large fires we were hiding one floor up something heavy fell sasha threw himself toward the door shouting that it was probably father they had thrown father were defiling the corpse probably throwing it in the fire going to burn it i heard it and the sound was kind of hollow and i said no that s from some of the furniture mother and i pounced on sasha and stopped him somehow and calmed him down the mob left somewhere around eight o clock they smashed open the door and went into the apartment of the neighbors across from us they were also armenians they had left for another city the father of the neighbor who was concealing us came and said are you crazy why are you hiding armenians don t you now they re checking all the apartments they could kill you and them and to us come on leave this apartment we went down to the third floor to some other neighbors at first the man didn t want to let us in but then one of his sons asked him and he relented we stayed there until eleven o clock at night we heard the sound of motors the neighbors said that it was armored personnel carriers we went downstairs there was a light on in the room where we left father in the other rooms as we found out later all the chandeliers had been torn down they left only one bulb the bulb was burning which probably was a signal they had agreed on because there was a light burning in every apartment in our microdistrict where there had been a pogrom with the help of the soldiers we made it to the city party committee and were saved our salvation my mother s my brother s and mine was purely accidental because as we later found out from the neighbors someone in the crowd shouted that we had firearms up there well we fought but we were only able to save mother we couldn t save father we inflicted many injuries on the bandits some of them serious but others came to take their places we were also wounded there was blood and we were scratched all over we got our share it was a miracle we survived we were saved by a miracle and the troops and if troops hadn t come to sumgait the slaughter would have been even greater probably all the armenians would have been victims of the genocide through an acquaintance at the city party committee i was able to contact the leadership of the military unit that was brought into the city and at their orders we were assigned special people to accompany us experts we went to pick up father s corpse we took it to the morgue this was about two o clock in the morning it was already march it was raining very hard and it was quite cold and we were wearing only our suits when my brother and i carried father into the morgue we saw the burned and disfigured corpses there were about six burned people in there and the small corpse of a burned child it was gruesome i suffered a tremendous shock there were about ten people there but the doctor on duty said that because of the numbers they were being taken to baku there was a woman s corpse there too she had been well there was part of a body there a hacked off part of a woman s body it was something terrible the morgue was guarded by the landing force the child that had been killed was only ten or twelve years old it was impossible to tell if it was a boy or a girl because the corpse was burned there was a man there too several men you couldn t tell anything because their faces were disfigured they were in such awful condition now two and a half months have passed every day i recall with horror what happened in the city of sumgait every day my father and the death of my father and how we fought and the people s sorrow and especially the morgue i still want to say that years have passed since soviet power was established and up to the very last minute we could not conceive of what happened in sumgait it will go down in history i m particularly surprised that the mob wasn t even afraid of the troops they even fought the soldiers many soldiers were wounded the mob threw fuel mixtures onto the armored personnel carriers setting them on fire they weren t afraid they were so sure of their impunity that they attacked our troops i saw the clashes on february near the airline ticket office right across from our building and that mob was fighting with the soldiers the inhabitants of some of the buildings also azerbaijanis threw rocks at the soldiers from windows balconies even cinder blocks and glass tanks they weren t afraid of them i say they were sure of their impunity when we were at the neighbors and when they were robbing homes near the airline ticket office i called the police at number and said that they were robbing armenian apartments and burning homes and they told me that they knew that they were being burned during those days no one from the police department came to anyone s aid no one came to help us either to our home even though perhaps they could have come and saved us as we later found out the mob was given free vodka and drugs near the bus station rocks were distributed in all parts of town to be thrown and used in fighting so i think all of it was arranged in advance they even knew in which buildings and apartments the armenians lived on which floors they had lists the bandits you can tell that the operation was planned in advance thanks of course to our troops to the country s leadership and to the leadership of the ministry of defense for helping us thanks to the russian people because the majority of the troops were russians and the troops suffered losses too i want to express this gratitude in the name of my family and in the name of all armenians and in the name of all sumgait armenians for coming in time and averting terrible things worse would have happened if that mob had not been stopped on time at present an investigation is being conducted on the part of the ussr procuracy i want to say that those bandits should receive the severest possible punishment because if they don t the tragedy the genocide could happen again everyone should see that the most severe punishment is meted out for such deeds very many bandits and hardened hooligans took part in the unrest in the mass disturbances the mobs were huge at present not all of them have been caught very few of them have been i think judging by the newspaper reports there were around people near our building alone that s how many people took part in the pogrom of our building all in all they should all receive the most severe punishment so that others see that retribution awaits those who perform such acts may yerevan

numbers of massacred men children and women are greatly minimized there is no known writing directly attributable to menachem begin which admits a massacre at deir yassin thus hasan is wrong as per request of hasan from the revolt by menachem begin dell publishing ny pp apart from the military aspect there is a moral aspect to the story of dir yassin at that village whose name was publicized throughout the world both sides suffered heavy casualties we had four killed and nearly forty wounded the number of casualties was nearly forty percent of the total number of the attackers the arab troops suffered casualties neraly three times as heavy the fighting the word troops is unjustified there has never been any evidence that there were any regular or irregular arab forces in the village apart from the villagers defending themselves according to the haganah observer pa il the irgun lehi forces suffered a lot of casualties because they were incompetent soldiers when they ran into trouble securing the central part of the village a small group of palmach soldiers came and took it without a single casualty begin s failure to even mention the palmach is only one of the major inaccuracies to use a kind word in his account incidentally three times as heavy may be correct as there is serious evidence that the arab loss was closer to lives than to the oft quoted lives however note that begin compares wounded jews to dead arabs he fails to mention the number of wounded arabs guess why was thus very severe yet the hostile propaganda disseminated throughout the world deliberately ignored the fact that the civilian population of dir yassin was actually given a warning by us before the battle began one of our tenders carrying a loud speaker was stationed at the entrance to the village and it exhorted in arabic all women children and aged to leave their houses and to take shelter on the slopes of the hill by giving this humane warning our fighters threw away the element of complete surprise and thus increased their own risk in the ensuing battle as is thoroughly established by many sources the loudspeaker truck got stuck in a ditch too far from the village for it to provide a usueful warning a substantial number of the inhabitants obeyed the warning and they were unhurt a few did not leave their stone houses perhaps because of the confusion the fire of the enemy was murderous to which the number of our casualties bears eloquent testimony our men were compelled to fight for every house to overcome the enemy they used large numbers of hand grenades and the civilians who had disregarded our warnings suffered inevitable casualties the education which we gave our soldiers throughout the years of revolt was based on the observance of the traditional laws of war we never broke them unless the enemy first did so and thus forced us in accordance with the accepted custom of war to apply reprisals i am convinced too that our officers and men wished to avoid a single unnecessary casualty in the dir yassin battle but those who throw stones of denunciation at the conquerors of dir yassin would do well not to don the cloak of hypocrisy in connection with the capture of dir yassin the jewish agency found it necessary to send a letter of apology to abdullah whom mr ben gurion at a moment of great political emotion called the wise ruler who seeks the good of his people and this country the wise ruler whose mercenary forces demolished gush etzion and flung the bodies of its heroic defenders to birds of prey replied with feudal superciliousness he rejected the apology and replied that the jews were all to blame and that he did not believe in the existence of dissidents throughout the arab world and the world at large a wave of lying propaganda was let loose about jewish attrocities the enemy propaganda was designed to besmirch our name in the result it helped us panic overwhelmed the arabs of eretz israel kolonia village which had previously repulsed every attack of the haganah was evacuated overnight and fell without further fighting beit iksa was also evacuated these two places overlooked the main road and their fall together with the capture of kastel by the haganah made it possible to keep open the road to jerusalem in the rest of the country too the arabs began to flee in terror even before they clashed with jewish forces not what happened at dir yassin but what was invented about dir yassin helped to carve the way to our decisive victories on the battlefield the legend of dir yassin helped us in particular in the saving of tiberias and the conquest of haifa it is worth noting how begin disputes the standard myth that the palestinian arabs fled as part of a calculated plan a footnote from the revolt pp to counteract the loss of dir yassin a village of strategic importance arab headquarters at ramallah broadcast a crude atrocity story alleging a massacre by irgun troops of women and children in the village certain jewish officials fearing the irgun men as political rivals seized upon this arab gruel propaganda to smear the irgun an eminent rabbi was induced to reprimand the irgun before he had time to sift the truth out of evil however good came this arab propaganda spread a legend of terror amongst arabs and arab troops who were seized with panic at the mention of irgun soldiers the legend was worth half a dozen battalions to the forces of israel the dir yassin massacre lie is still propagated by jew haters all over the world apparently of israeli historians are jew
